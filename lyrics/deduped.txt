and it seems to me theres a means to and end
and it served his legend well
and it serves a hundred ships a day
and it shined into these eyes
and it sounds so right
and it starts with the beat of a drum far away
and it sticks
and it sucks to be all in your head wondering where this thing could go but

and it sure was a grand waste of time
and it turned into gymnastics
and it waits for you
and it was all yellow
and it was called yellow
and it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
and it will pass you by
and it will remain there till i wish to retrieve it
and it wont go away till our dreams are fulfilled
and it wont last to sulk with the memories you hold
and it would seem that weve still got a long long way to go

around me tightly
around the icy waters underground

as apollo sets beyond your head
as does my time
as each day goes by
as far as i can see
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn
as far as the past nevermind that
as far can be
as for me i am blind without a cause
as he climbs he dares
as he reluctantly
as he walks away she slowly breaks a smile
as her body once did
as her mourners watch her burn
as hes walking away
as high as a kite
as i adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
as i co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem
as i count the rings around my eyes
as i grow older you grow wiser
as i injected the candy heart that i selected
as i lay me down to sleep
as i lay there with her by my side
as i lie bleeding here i still
as i lie there with my tongue spread wide open
as i look at the picture
as i look back at hard it seems
as i look to you
as i open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
as i pulled away slowly
as i rest my head to go to sleep
as i sit around and watch you pout
as i sit in my chair and watch life go by
as i sit in this smokey room
as i sit up here and wonder bout how you sold your mind body and soul
as i stand here before my woman
as i stand here before my woman 
as i told you from the beginning i dont have money
as i turn out the light
as i walk down the highway all i do is sing a song
as i walk i can never seem to escape
as i was growin up
as i was headed out towards the door
as i watched her leave
as i watched my mother die i lost my head
as i wonder
as i write this letter
as if he never even mattered
as if i really care
as if i wasnt there
as if you blame
as if youre gonna get away with this
as im doing my hair
as it began
as it eats its way across the land
as it was so long ago
as kids we used to laugh
as long as all in all you remain grateful
as long as i be on my paper cause im gon let nothing in front of me after my currency flow
as long as i can sang with you like
as long as i live i never want a wife
as long as theres
as long as were promised tomorrow
as long as weve been together
as long as you dont abuse it
as long as you look me in the eyes
as long as youre right here next to me everythings gonna be alright
as long as youre with me baby
as long as youve got your radio
as long if you do the usual
as many feet walk through the door
as my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
as my victims bleed
as of late my verses seem not so versey
as pleasant as possible seat backs and tray tables must be in the upright lock
as round and round and round you go
as sad as it may seem
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
as she climbs her way
as she eating on my seamen
as she looked up at me
as she went for my midsection
as soon as  oclock goes around
as soon as i got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
as soon as i grip the mic to get loose
as soon as i touch down in they city
as strange as it seems
as the black guy took his aim
as the bright blue sky
as the businessmen slowly get stoned
as the drama gets deeper i put on the reefer
as the earth to the sun
as the end is drawing near
as the fogs getting thicker
as the girls admire the way i aspire
as the hating escalated
as the internet i let my flow to get to streamin im beamin
as the morning air laid on the latch
as the paperboy takes off without any news
as the phone rings again she just closes her eyes
as the sheep that he locked in the pen
as the smile ran away from his face
as the sound split the ngiht
as the speaker that spoke when they done speak
as the story gets told ill tell you a little bit more about yachty
as the telephones ringing on
as the torn and left in the cold seek vengeance on mistreated lives
as the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance on their mistreated lives
as the vinyl spin so slowly
as the winners toll the bell
as the years fast did roll
as they came to town to face another showdown
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
as they thank the lord the blind cant see
as though you might be thinking
as thousands of rocks
as time crumbles away
as time passes by regrets for the rest of my life
as to avoid the broken glass
as virgins and spectres sing
as we all look on in fiendish delight
as we get down in the world below
as we kicked around downtown waiting for the sun to rise
as we kiss the world goodbye
as we leave all our worries behind
as we listen to the music play
as we march to rhythm on the palace floor
as we race to beat days dusky grin
as we stand on our neighborhood corner know that this fire thats burning represents the passion you have listen
as we stood tall together
as we wake up in my car youre on my chest

but imma try and have you on the trip with me
but imma wake yo ass up
but in a box beneath my bed
but in all chaos there is calculation
but in my life i wanted more i needed more
but in our darkest hours i stumbled on a secret power
but in the bright light
but in the daylight
but in the end for you and me
but in the mean time im fightin gun charges in court
but in the mist of this insanity i found my christianity
but in the morning she dont remember it
but in the twilight its so hard to see
but in time i realized i was so wrong
but in voices loud and clear
but in your linen robes
but indeed them too can run me right up a tree
but inside im fine
but inside its cold i wonder why
but instead i spent a hundred on a new chain
but instead im in a lamborghini
but instead im in bed with the stage and the crew
but instead im in the trap though
but instead you took a cap
but ion saving no pigeons im a turn it up a notch for my team
but is it really truly in my plans
but is it so strange to be in love with you
but is that a good thing
but is that how she brought you up to blame the hand that feeds ya
but is the best you can be
but it aint easy yeah
but it aint killing me its boosting up my energy
but it aint what its cut out to be
but it all depends on all the things you do
but it be best if you get lost
but it can be taken away
but it dances in my head
but it doesnt seem fair
but it doesnt seem to matter
but it doesnt sound good to him or her or anyone oh oh
but it dont bring you closure
but it dont get no better
but it dont make me happy so we blow that
but it dont stop here i gotta keep it goin keep it goin
but it ends with you and me
but it feels good
but it feels like there was something
but it feels so far away
but it hurts it gets worse you know nobody said it would be fair
but it hurts me so inside
but it is nothing new you know it drives us insane
but it just done work that way
but it just dont work that way
but it keeps avoiding me
but it lifts me up when we are walkin
but it made his music better
but it never fails to leave me so mystified
but it never lasts for too long
but it only made her want him more
but it seems an obsession has started from the inside
but it seems like a thousand years
but it seems theres always somethin right there to remind me
but it sounds so dangerous to me now
but it takes so much mo
but it turns out that it only went so deep deep
but it was me that paid the debt he left behind
but it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company
but it wasnt a sin a sorry life in judging every action
but it wasnt my fault
but it wont hold me like you do
but it works out in the long run
but it would be wrong for me to stay
but itll be your money
but itll never be enough
but itll never be the same no oh no
but its  am and we bout to go up again
but its a must to duck duck duck
but its a must to get us ten feet high
but its about ta get ugly
but its about time
but its all eyes on me like im coppin some vows for the bar
but its all fine
but its all for you
but its all good dont stress though
but its all gravy im with baby makin millions now
but its all right cause i dont mind
but its all right dog everything gon be all right dog
but its alright
but its always two steps backwards
but its another story over here at drakes house
but its been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth
but its been such a long time
but its better than drinking alone
but its better to know all you can know
but its constantly low so you gotta stay high
but its cool because i got the title ho
but its cool cause we gon do the things that grownups do
but its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
but its gotta be the right time
but its great to hear youre doing fine
but its hard as hell the man above for showing me love
but its hard to find the meaning
but its hard to let go when your hearts broken
but its hard when im so rundown and
but its hard when youre young
but its harder to walk on your own
but its just
but its just a myth
but its just a supercut of us
but its just another pretty lie
but its just like me not to understand yeah
but its just the price i pay
but its killing me
but its love like cupid kissing a mistletoe
but its never never been to late

but she got me all up in my zone
but she got me wanna stick around for the second show
but she heard me in the club she put in work
but she kills me anyway
but she knew that she would be okay
but she knows my heart
but she look like the type that could take a dick
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners redemption
but she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
but she still breathin which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
but she sure knows what shes leavin behind
but she talk about it every time that we do things
but she tell me this her favorite song
but she told me keep my spirits up high
but she told me shed do a damn job on them boys
but she tried to front me in front of my friends
but she used to hold it down
but she was
but she was always there when i needed to phone a friend or use a life line
but she was gone with the morning sun
but she was lovin it all with her back in a arch
but she was so cool and so fresh and so fly

but since she was just a secretary worked for the church for thirtyfive years
but since you moved on up you aint cool with us
but slim and b done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
but slowly eats away
but so so
but some day one day
but some just went stir crazy lord cause
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
but some things a girl can never forget
but some things are better left unsaid
but somehow
but somehow i still love you but i hate you
but somehow i want more
but someone picked you from the bunch
but something bout this
but something didnt seem right
but something wasnt right
but sometimes my actions hurt
but somewhere down the line i left you hanging
but somewhere we went wrong

but soon she was down soon he was low
but sorry pops youll just have to wait
but springll soon be here

but still id look better than a puppet tryin to get paid
but still im coming home
but still remain the same
but still you proceed to dive deep ask whats her zodiac sign
but still you say
but still you tried to better me
but still youve got to go  away from here
but still youve got to go away from here
but swallow all my children
but take a long and distant search
but tease her bout crying on that picture
but tell the ostler that his name was
but that aint what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
but that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me
but that doesnt make me mad
but that dont stand for player hating
but that lil boy trouble
but that never meant a thing
but that place i call ambition now dead to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me
but that remains to be seen
but that was all good tho cause uh
but that was just a loan time to collect like im capone
but that way you love darlin know im brooklyn bound
but that way you love darlin know you give me my fill
but that will never be enough
but that wont work no more
but that would be a pretty dope song
but thats a secret i can never tell
but thats all right
but thats all right dude
but thats all right thats ok by me
but thats alright
but thats enough of that ima let my home girl sing
but thats high so im gettin my fade low
but thats not important
but thats not true cause i know you
but thats not what worries me
but thats the only way i knew how to begin
but thats the price we payin when we livin on the other side
but thats the price when you nice with it
but thats what happens when youre on your own
but thats what i need to let go
but thats whats bound to happen
but thats when the rain came
but the air you breathe
but the band they played our favorite song
but the beat listens just fine
but the beginning of time for you and i
but the burden is just too much im losing touch with myself and my health
but the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
but the chains and diamond rings
but the cowboys and the ranchers knew his name
but the cpd getting new recruitment
but the ending is the same every damn time
but the ending is the same every damn time no no no
but the feeling seems to stay
but the feelings overwhelming its much too strong
but the freaks aint trying to sleep with cracky
but the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
but the heart wants what it wants
but the heat came round and busted me
but the house gets cold when you cut the heating
but the hurt is for the better
but the la storys gone way out of hand
but the law never will
but the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
but the man had to put the last touches on his art
but the memories wont stop
but the music
but the one im looking at is right in front of me
but the ones that i love were in the ground
but the party dont stop no
but the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
but the people want more
but the pictures in my head were with you
but the price you pay to nowhere
but the proofs in the way it hurts
but the rain falls cold and the moon shines bright
but the rain wont fall for the both of us
but the ride dont never ever come for free noohoh
but the same thang make ya laugh make ya cry
but the show it cant go on
but the smell of it consumes it takes all my mind
but the storm came fast
but the suns been quite kind while i wrote this song
but the tears were silent inside you see
but the time has come to leave
but the toy can feel
but the trees begin to walk
but the truth is
but the very next day you gave it away
but the way them schoolgirls look at you
but the way them women been lookin at you
but the way you act you never would know its there
but the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
but the way you wrappin round me is a prob
but the whole world told me never mind
but the wind wont blow we really shouldnt go
but then again how are we to know
but then again lord ive seen a lot of fools
but then again you know what
but then he runs
but then i saw your bitterness
but then i saw your bitterness and why you left me too
but then i stop trippin as soon as i hit the bong
but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
but then my dream level popped
but then somethin i saw in your eyes
but then you disappear and make me wait
but then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way
but then youll do whatever i like
but then your eyes start to wander
but there aint nothing i can do so keep dancin baby keep dancin dancin
but there doesnt have to be a reason
but there is one voice that has never been heard before the voice of old mr world himself the way he might sound if he could speak to us in our own language mr world how was this wonderful orderly earth of ours formed in the first place and how long has it been going on
but there never seems to be
but there was a time
but there were christmases whe i didnt
but there were christmases when you were mine
but therell always be a first time you get burned
but theres a change
but theres a couple of reasons that im suffering and grieving
but theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
but theres a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
but theres a rainbow above you
but theres logic behind it
but theres no drug around quite like what i found in you
but theres no erasing and the best advice i got
but theres no greater pressure than an artist on the verge
but theres no other
but theres no place a man can go
but theres nothing i can do but take the pain
but theres nothing left for you to say
but theres one thing on my mind its all for you
but theres only way imma know
but theres someplace that hed rather be
but theres something about ya
but theres something about you
but theres something that i guarantee
but these feelings just keep comin back
but these kids these days they get so high burn trees smoke chlorophyll
but they all know its something
but they all say that its early to sign me
but they call her desdemona
but they call it the news
but they call me round eye when im chilin in japan
but they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
but they caught me nondodging long arming the people yup
but they didnt know me last year yeah
but they dont know me yet
but they dont know what i know
but they dont like me
but they dont really understand the masterpiece ive found
but they dont see you crying in the shower
but they dont understand
but they dont wanna give us the respect right
but they got you doing softcore background work
but they have to like the bbbass
but they just hurdles
but they just on a quest to be some rock stars
but they keep coming from wall to wall
but they kept on rocking
but they really your enemies with secret indentities
but they saw it fit that i talk right
but they scared to let it surface uh
but they think this saves us from our hell
but they took it and held it for ransom
but they wont give you the credit disses out they mouth
but theyll get theirs eventually
but theyre never gonna know im gonna move like hell
but things come and go
but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
but think about the baby
but this bastards flow will bash your skull
but this blood in my veins
but this bottles my only friend
but this dress is another tone
but this feeling inside my heart
but this feeling is so damn good
but this feels so right
but this house is not a home without you baby
but this is real life real life
but this is summer playing dumber than in fall
but this is what you say
but this life that i chose to live sometimes strange
but this old town just seems so hopeless
but this right here so time consuming
but this summer is different its a two man operation
but this the life i made though
but this time i take away your misery and make it mine
but this time i wear no sandals
but this time its different darling youll see
but this time this time
but this time youve gone way too far
but this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
but this was better left unsaid
but those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
but those four pink walls now i kinda miss them man
but those spies hide out in every corner
but till shes here
but till then you better
but time comes to rest when you are by my side
but times of need are not enough
but to call it wasting time oh thats a crime
but to find that its not different at all
but to get it you have to realize
but to hell wit ya
but to make room ill vanish
but to tell you the truth everybody
but to you they no good
but today i board this rocket ship and sonic boom
but tomorrow i will wake up and ill know

but under the chaos i see through
but under these conditions she was with it
but understand growin up son i never had a dime
but until then
but until then load up the chrome cause its on
but violate it get that ass annihilated
but violent use brings violent plans
but wait a minute here comes my baby
but wait a minute i dont understand
but was just a virgin couldnt make it past flirting
but was standing in the dark
but watch one day ill be pimp of the nation
but watch them hoes who want the change
but way too close to the light
but we aint gon trip
but we aint never giving up
but we aint sayin nothin
but we always forget
but we broke it more
but we can make it to jacobs and to the dealership
but we can win wait lets get straight to the point
but we cant have no picket fence cause we got acres and acres of land
but we care
but we could still pretend
but we dont feel like outsiders at all
but we dont have to rush something real
but we dont play no ball
but we gon keep bakin till the day we get cake
but we got enough she aint gotta work
but we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop
but we got priors like richard
but we gotta do it slowly
but we hold on hm hold on
but we hold on hm hold on yeah
but we hold on hmm hold on

but we love you we love you baby
but we not friendly either you know it
but we persevere force fear enemies saying we want nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
but we show him respect
but we smiled at the yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
but we walked that road before
but we were nervous on the surface
but we will be very shortly
but well a find a way
but well be around some more
but well never see it
but well never stop well never quit cause were metallica
but were always in a hurry now
but were gonna try rambling on
but were not here to make your children bleed
but were still unaware as why
but were the greatest
but were trying way too hard
but weve been going through this thang since way back
but weve got nothing here
but what do want from me its just a stupid bar
but what i really mean is
but what i really want
but what is and what should never be
but what she said next took me for a spin
but what the hell
but what the hell is this world coming to
but what they dont accept and what they dont see
but what they want her to be is weak
but what will we do when were sober
but what would be the answer to the answer man
but what you can consider that if it goes down
but whatever you do
but whats done is done
but whats this extra bed just here
but when i come off the road well i just got to have my time
but when i dig you with my spurs
but when i do i might need help up
but when i feel that i i cant go on
but when i get home to you
but when i get up
but when i hear the beat im tempted to make another attempt at it
but when i hit it like a hit stick i make it shock yeah
but when i reach for you
but when i see you dancing there
but when i see you standing there
but when i show my piece
but when i start pokin back they get all uptight
but when i wake up and your makeup is on my shoulder
but when i whispered in her ear i lost another friend oh
but when im drunk i act a fool
but when im in my car dont give me no crap
but when it comes it goes
but when it got hard she would lose her focus
but when it looks you in the eyes
but when it rains it pours for real
but when she had contact with the conflict
but when she puts her arms around me
but when that santa fe pulls in
but when the beefs on them real ogs
but when the wind blows im so marilyn
but when the world drives you out and your gas tank is on e
but when they play take you down chris brown i am his standin
but when they realize that i gotta grind
but when they stabbed
but when they stabbed you
but when they strike we light up the world
but when they turn they back i just have jesus leadin my path
but when we get together be electric slidin
but when were dancing im alright
but when you call me baby
but when you catch the lice or get the urgency
but when you come around
but when you left me babe
but when you opened up the door my life completely changed
but when you see me
but when you tell me youre through
but when you think of me
but when you think tim mcgraw
but when youre lookin for somebody
but where do we seem to fall
but where in the lookingglass fields of illusion
but where is the child who played with the sun chimes
but while yall washin watch him
but who would think the raps would turn into racks
but whos not these days
but why do i
but why does everybody tell me no
but why him i hear em hate
but why must we retaliate is it human nature
but why why why cant it be
but why you living out your idols dreams

but you aint never heard about me
but you aint never put in work there
but you aint seen the worst yet
but you aint thandie newton and this aint crash here
but you aint worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action

but you came along and made me see
but you can be yourself with me
but you can blow me cause you dont know how i feel
but you can bring yours lets see what you got
but you can catch kid rock on a hot day rollin on the island
but you can have that mister banker
but you can keep em for the birds and bees
but you can lay with me so it doesnt hurt
but you can show me so politely
but you can wade in the water and never get wet
but you cant blame me for who ive met lately
but you cant bring yourself to say no
but you cant go
but you cant oh
but you cant touch them no
but you cause me pain most every time you breath cryin eyes
but you could write me a letter for to save me from agoin insane ha ha
but you couldnt walk
but you cried bout this
but you dont buzz the flower
but you dont feel the same showin no empathy
but you dont have my luxeries
but you dont have to do anything else
but you dont know anything other than that
but you dont know hes door to door
but you dont know it yet
but you dont know where to begin
but you dont mean nothing to me
but you dont see my hesitation
but you dont take it no more you sick and tired of it
but you dont tell anyone

it all fits so right
it all just seems like such a waste
it all means the same
it all started when i lost my mother
it almost felt as good as when i got my first chain
it always comes as a surprise
it always feels like its rockthirty in my mind
it always runs where i hide
it amazes me how points it scores
it b that cash money piece cold restin the dead
it be ashes to ashes dust to dust
it be me her and her tell em all the more freaks
it beats me down a little further every single day
it been so long ive had this feeling
it beez the brothers representin the dirty dozen
it better be gushy it better be hairless
it blurs
it breaks into a song
it burns like mace in my face a vodka shot straight no chase when i think of us being erased
it came faster than a blink of an eye
it came from the breast just spread to the spine
it came to me from you
it came unknown to me
it cant be that easy for you to get like that
it come out sweeter than old sadie
it comes at me
it could be anybody tell me are you that somebody
it could be qc or even maybe its me
it could be that  hour flight shopping in beverly
it could be the man i used to be girl
it could be time to die
it could mean a lot for me
it didnt take me long
it disappeared with time it never made much sense
it do not matter
it doesnt matter anymore

it doesnt matter to me cause i will
it doesnt matter what they say
it doesnt matter which direction though
it doesnt matter whose dads richest now

it falls into peaces new
it feel good to b yung money cash money
it feel good wakin up to money in the bank
it feels bad to be alone
it feels better biting down
it feels closer
it feels good waking up to money in the bank
it feels like im suffocatin from
it feels like weve been out at sea oh
it feels like youre a million miles away
it feels so peaceful
it feels so right now
it feels so scary getting old
it feels so strange
it flowed upon the cobbled floor
it forms when darkness is increased by one
it frightens me you know
it gets annoying from time to time i gotta ignore her
it gets more and more intense
it gets quiet they see the rims twenty four seventy
it gets so hot in here
it gets tougher to watch when its yo self you got a fear of
it gets worse here every day
it go one two three two in the front one in the back seat seat seat
it go with the beat i told em its the music
it goes and its golden like sands of time
it goes down in the lunch room
it goes one by one even two by two
it goes to show lord you just cant tell
it got me freezin dog
it got me pissed this family and my momma too
it happened back in the bayou many years ago
it happened once before
it heals the soul
it hit so deep i closed my eyes and i just took off running
it hits me without warning your reflection walking by
it hurt as a child tied down
it hurt as a child tied down you would hit me
it hurt im not a liar
it hurt it hurt so youll never know
it hurts but it may be the only way
it hurts if it dont seems
it hurts like hell
it hurts on the usual
it is a big business and seems to be advanicng underground
it is amazing
it is an honor to introduce
it is beginning oh it is beginning
it is believing oh it is believing
it is disturbing this isnt mine
it is fear it is fear it is fear
it is going to take your breath away
it is haunting this takes my mind
it is him i love it is him
it is him i love it is him i love
it is just time for me to rest my head
it is knowing oh it is knowing
it is not dying it is not dying
it is not normal
it is nothing now i said it is nothing now
it is now my duty to completely drain you
it is shining oh it is shining
it is so stupid
it is something special you have
it is the most disgusting thing i have ever heard
it is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snappin
it isnt like i wanna sift through the decay
it isnt over yet
it itches it seethes it festers and breathes
it jumped so high it touched the sky
it just got complicated i dont know what to do
it just got warm out
it just seems so useless to have to work so hard
it just set me free
it just sucks that one of them will never come true
it just tears me apart
it just wont come come
it keeps going on day after day son
it keeps me through the day
it keeps my head spinning around waste away
it keeps rattling my cage
it kicks your ass kick your face exploding feeling nears
it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
it learned how to fit into my foreplay
it left a smoking crater of my mind
it like makes me upset i am now nauseous and i cant eat lunch
it look like i took a piss
it made complete sense theres someone else you like
it made me feel good
it made me nervous to know you didnt like me i really tried
it made the rain that came seem strange
it make me crawl out of my high shes good shes good to me
it makes me crazy i want to let you know
it makes me feel alright
it makes me feel like were doing something right
it makes me lose control i just cant trust myself
it makes me lose control i want to hurt myself
it makes me mad
it makes me want to go out and make it all mine
it makes me wonder when i grow to be that age
it makes me wonder why im still here
it makes no difference baby
it makes you really smart man
it makes you worse
it may be early to be planning this stuff
it may be quite simple but now that its done
it may be rainin
it maybe could be my star status
it means so much to me
it meant nothing to you saving my seven dollars
it might be easier to stay
it might be too late but the songs will live on
it might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
it must be hard
it must be hard for your projects to take all that
it must be love im feeling
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
it must be race
it must have been the sight of tears that
it must have been your bunny shake
it must have been your funny face
it must have been your love
it must have been your love i gotta give it that
it must have been your love i said
it must have been your love in a little bit
it must have been your poppy eyes
it never ends
it never ends with the gifts luna sends to the apocalypse
it never quite got off the ground
it never stops you cant be everything to everyone
it only goes to show that you will be mine by takin our time
it only goes to showow that you will be mine by takin our time
it only reminds me of you
it only takes
it only takes one shot to floor ya
it only takes ooh
it only takes two hours to nevada
it only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
it opens my mind to feelings
it picks me up and makes me whole
it proves that im in heaven mama
it rainbow spirals round and round
it ran by my door
it really is
it rebounds so i caught it off the backboard
it returns and when it lands
it runs away
it says so much its no surprise to you
it seemed like only its the days that we did it that you hold me like a i did it
it seemed perfect the concept free from any regret
it seems all so well laid out but i cannot get through
it seems as though ive lived my life
it seems i cant break away
it seems i have been here before
it seems life is always different when we open our eyes
it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
it seems like every plug we needs to utah became mormons drought comes around feels like i have no one to depend on
it seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but every time we fall up in it
it seems like everything i say just starts another fight
it seems like pain and regret are your best friends
it seems sometimes im only good at being gone
it seems such a waste of breath
it seems that all the friends ive got just got to come interrogate me
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
it seems the last thing on your mind
it seems the only things i know are far from home
it seems to me its been too easy for you for too long
it seems we cant go anywhere
it seems we living the american dream
it seems we often want to start but never get to finish
it seems you take the light
it slips away into darkness
it something bout this feeling its crazy
it sounds like you need a friend a friend
it sounds wicky wacky ticky tacky
it started happening thats all you know
it started in the kitchen king of the whipping
it started out with a kiss
it starts to show
it takes  millions years for a diamond to shine
it takes two not three but im here any way
it tears me up inside
it took a path just to get me here
it took all of me not to answer
it took me sometime to see it
it took over and weighed heavily on her shoulder
it took us a life time to find eachother
it trembled and exploded
it trembles and explodes
it up i cook it up and get some
it used to be lambeths finest array
it wants what it wants
it wants what it wants baby
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
it was a bright light
it was a dream and then it hit me reality struck
it was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of july
it was a matter of time
it was a moment of weakness
it was a risk just for a mistress who was a hostess on the westcoast
it was a tragic case of my reality
it was a very good year
it was about five minutes ago
it was acceptable at the time
it was acceptable in the s
it was all a bunch of mush
it was all a dream just a year ago
it was all a lie
it was all about the cost
it was all friendly on my end
it was all in an instant man
it was all over your face
it was all so simple when
it was all yours
it was always lets go try to pull some hoes
it was always your home and your business that came first
it was awesome and thank you it was good to meet you tim
it was awesome uh except for i didnt know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old
it was cloudy around my way i gride hard and never settle
it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i didnt say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldnt take it too bad
it was down to you and i
it was fun girl
it was fun to be young
it was hot as ever today
it was hustle time and yall walked it out
it was impossible on the road every week but i know enough
it was in your eyes that looks been there for too long
it was just one of those days
it was lethal it was fatal
it was like the sixes came out the jordan sixes
it was lil wayne two puppies one child and a dike
it was meant to be
it was meant to begin kind of slow anyway
it was meant to sit close to the bone anyway
it was murder she wrote your name in blood
it was my past life
it was on and
it was one dull morning
it was one week later when i peeped her at the bus stop
it was only a kiss
it was only getting they feelings hurt tell me how that sound
it was only right they gave me half a mil
it was over before it began
it was permanent
it was predicted by a medic
it was really really good
it was some type of love
it was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
it was something real
it was straight embarrassing how yall played him
it was strange i could not look away
it was the moment of bliss
it was the needle and the spoon
it was the questions we had wrong

it was their idea i proved to be a man
it was time putting nothing above you not even the cake
it was two plus me equals threesome time
it was worth the wait caus i fuinally found the one

nothing can keep me from you
nothing can make me stay
nothing can stop us we got it all
nothing can take away the time and the memories we had
nothing changes just rearranges for me this time
nothing comes to change my life
nothing could go wrong
nothing could satisfy you till you left
nothing else but love can burn as bright
nothing else feels right without love
nothing ere need come between us tell me love what do you say 
nothing huh am i square cause i dont puff a square
nothing hurts my world
nothing i can kill

the easiest way to sell your soul is to carry on believing that we dont exist
the edges of you keep me holy
the eighties
the electric co
the electronics of your heart
the elevators working overtime up and down
the emptiness behind your eyes
the empty bottled loneliness this happiness you seek the masochism that you preach

the lawmen cleared the people from the streets
the lawyers fee so they never keep you
the lean taste good
the leather armies have prevailed
the leaves are falling all around time i was on my way
the length ive gone are just long miles
the leprachaun sees what my palm reads
the letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
the lies get exposed soon as you win it
the lies you spin for your power trip
the life i made
the life is fading from me
the life of a don we living like kings and killing our pawns
the life you have disguised
the light of day will never tell lies
the light shed on me was a dim gleam
the light that shines within
the lights are out
the lights come on and down the drive
the lights go off
the lights in my hand and the beat in my face
the lights the love the rights the wrongs
the lily of the valley doesnt know
the lily pond the skylarks song
the line is breaking up
the linen hanging loose now let the loop down
the lines that crack your face
the lips i am missing
the little bombardier
the little boy smiled itll all be well
the little that he made
the little things never seem to end
the little things that you do
the little things they bring
the logical one
the long way
the longarmed khalifa reachin with each verse
the look in her eyes the smell of her hair
the look upon their faces as i
the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
the love i get from you is something i cant chance
the love that i have left behind is gonna finish me
the love thats shining all around me
the love thats shining all around you
the love the love is
the love the passion but most of all
the lovely one im thinking of
the lover in me is the lover in you
the loves gone only hatred is left
the mac sweeper the six shot pump that sawd off
the maids come around too much
the main cause of our stay
the man from the magazine
the man gave me a luck charm
the man is back in town
the man is evil and that is right
the man said childhood
the man you fight
the many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
the many years ive tried
the mark i breathe on you
the mark of a new kind of man

this road never looked so lonely
this rugged style steals your brain
this saint laurent mama you look nice too
this second verse is dedicated to rappers that never made it
this seems lifes underground

this shining city built of gold

this side this side this side this side
this slow life im waiting for you
this somethin every real ngga can feel here
this song aint for my album
this song goes out to anybody trying to get by
this song is for lovers out there
this song is for the better
this sounds like an elevator music
this spot in hells where i belong
this sudden fear has left me trembling
this summer but committed to you
this tattoo on my left hand is turning purpleish blue
this that derek jeter on his last catch
this that feeling that you get from all these knock outs
this that fire
this that inspiration for the moes and the folks man
this that jimi hendrix on his last string
this that larry davis on his last bang
this that tiger woods on his last swing
this that wayne gretzky on his last scratch
this that whitney houston on her last track
this the kinda pain i just couldnt take away
this the life i was living
this the life that i chose bought out the store cant go back no more
this the present and im a show you what gifted is man
this the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
this the sequel lookin down like an eagle
this the type of music that you make when you round that
this thing
this thirst in my soul
this this heres the epic tale
this this is our new song
this this tell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen
this thumbnail size of heart is black as coal
this time
this time around ima let my nuts and my platinum charms hang
this time girl ive had enough
this time i look to see whats between the lines
this time i swear its different
this time i think shes gonna blow
this time if you die
this time im blabbin on
this time im coming up for air
this time imma get it right
this time ive really lost my mind and i dont care
this time maryjane wont save me
this time my fortunes faded
this time please someone come and rescue me
this time she mistreated me
this time this time
this time youre different and determined to go
this times the last time
this to the men who would wanna get wit me
this towns no longer fun
this track is gettin over written
this true love rocafella till i die
this was all inspired by a little marvin gaye and chardonnay
this was never up to me
this was the perfect timing
this wasnt my dream
this wasnt supposed to happen
this water is
this water is deep
this we bring to you
this week he moppin floors next week its the fries
this what happen when i think about you
this what i got to meet her
this what it sound like when god split an atom with me
this where we find em
this where your dick belong
this will never end when ill bleed forever
this will take you down
this will take your life
this wish is true
this world is ours for the takinq
this world is what im facing
this world mine
this would be a pretty dope song
this wouldnt be the right thing to do
this wounded dog in the street is sure lookin good
this year
this year can you
this year my cd gone be the sickest thing droppin
this year to save me from tears
this you know i understand
this young boy is a problem
thisaway
tho it takes a little longer
tho were apart youre part of me still
thoroughbred im a winner
those angry dogs those angry dogs
those are for the deeper end
those bars that look towards the sun
those be the best memories
those brown eyes crying in a crowded bar
those doors flew back
those few hours linger on in my head
those girls be wondering why i havent been around
those great whites they have big teeth
those is mike amiri jeans though
those lips are colorful all of the time
those little things
those people who tell you not to take chances
those preppy boys in blue theyre making fun of us
those pretty faces always seemed
those the type of lines that im talking bout
those things that i said
those things they believe in they get hazy i think i mean it
those things we found
those three empty words
those were memories that have been by so fast
those were the days baby you were truth
those who aint even black use it
those will be the best memories
those wyrm tainted bastard leeches black hand sucks
though a bend in my behind would get kissed
though everyone said that she was so strong
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
though her road leads away
though i cant go on
though i dont know how start
though i dont know what the use is
though i know it wouldnt change your feelings
though i know its wrong
though i know youll never love me like you used to
though i stray
though i try to see you differently
though ill be laid down on the floor
though im living and im singing
though it might seem wrong thank god for that white
though it seem like he gon blow
though its hard when the climb gets steep
though she is the kryptonite
though the fans want the feeling of a tribe called quest
though the seasons change so quickly
though the silver lining wears through
though these hard times are bugging me now
though they wonder why i always got my clique by me
though this is all for you dont want to hide the truth
though we never saw the sunshine
though we will never be here again
though were far apart
though you say our love is just a game
thought about lettin them get a cut then i went and snagged at it
thought about my baby
thought he was a queen i drdrdragged him
thought i could leave you cause i felt my heart numbing
thought i didnt need a bed to fall asleep
thought i didnt need love to be complete
thought i didnt need shoes on my feet
thought i had the same effect on you
thought i knew it all but i aint know anything
thought i was above you
thought i was done i was savaged by the sun
thought i was strong enough for you
thought i would see the day we grew apart and i wanna know
thought id see whats up
thought it was a brick till he put it in the bowl
thought it was cool
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
thought it was the end
thought my sunday love was waiting home for me
thought of being ousted
thought of something important baby it is nothing now
thought on your body i came alive
thought that i was doin somethin good for the game
thought that i was jokin
thought that id never fall in love never fall in love again
thought that you would stay forever with me
thought they could get rid a da twist of the tongue
thought they loved me when i made it
thought we belong together
thought we knew it all but just couldnt predict the weather
thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
thought you might like to know
thought you said that you would always be in love
thought you were under the radar
thought youd like to know that
thoughts are haunting me as i look around
thoughts are on the wall
thoughts arrive like butterflies
thoughts of her wont let me be
thoughts of me exemplified
thoughts of nothing but freaking that im struggling to keep in
thoughts of you

were a trainwreck waiting to happen
were all alone were all alone
were all alone were alone
were all animals out in the dark
were all diving in it
were all fugitives look at the way we live
were all the same
were all tryin to get along
were almost there baby one more step
were almost there only one more step
were always doing all the things
were always looking out for one another
were at an end
were behaving like teenagers
were big enough
were bigger than we ever dreamed
were biting our nails youre biting my lip
were blazing on that new found haze
were both the last to be leaving
were burning down the bridges this time
were captured in her eyes
were crossed and terrored ravages of architecture
were crying crying so let the velvet roll down down
were dancing like were dumdumdudududumb
were dead
were delirious
were doing everything
were drifting
were drivin down the road i wonder if you know
were dying fast
were fallin in love
were falling apart still we hold together
were falling down
were falling off the edge again
were falling together
were fine all by ourselves
were fly enough to make the sell see us still were fearing heights
were gathered here to maim and kill cause this is what we choose
were gettin close to danger zone
were getting dead and its the right way
were getting dead and its the right way to do it
were getting good at this
were getting in your head
were going left on right
were going on hold on
were going out with a bang
were going round in circles
were going through the motions
were going to go home again
were going to infest
were gonna do a little chugging
were gonna do a little hugging
were gonna get a little out of control
were gonna go walkin through the park every day
were gonna hate you till you leave
were gonna hit one at a time time
were gonna hit the road for one last time
were gonna im gonna cheer you up
were gonna kiss a little
were gonna last forever
were gonna live in century city
were gonna live in the modern world
were gonna make it girl
were gonna sail leave todaya
were gonna take you away
were gonna write a little letter
were havin fun
were here to cover ground with a tumbleweed
were here to eat you
were here to live our lives
were hollow like the bottles that we drain
were in a sticky situation
were in the promised land
were in this together
were jumping off the wings
were just a little bit more in focus
were just friends what are you saying
were just holding on to could have beens
were laid spread out before me
were lifted
were like glue
were livin a lie livin a lie this needs to change
were living ultralife
were looking for something dumb to do
were loveless
were making waves of conversation
were merrymaking all the stuff that youve been taking
were more than machines
were movin oh yes we are
were movin oh yes we are cause
were movin were getting out
were movin were goin far
were movin without a doubt
were moving forward and theres no regrets
were moving on we got no regrets
were never done with killing time
were never ever gonna make it far
were never to be
were not done yet
were off where the wind blows
were on each others team
were on the surface now
were one in the river and one again after the fall
were only sorry that we have to end the show
were out of time were out of time and its still the same
were painted red to fit right in whoa
were part of god it was an incredible feeling
were really fighting ourselves
were related in feeling but youre high above
were riding on a whim
were rocking back and forth
were rolling suicide
were sellin our clothes sleepin in cars
were setting up to fail
were sleeping through all the days
were so happy even when were smilin out of fear
were spending too much time alone
were still holding that old thing tryna rob me of it
were still talking everyday
were talking out the world
were tearin it aparparparpapapart
were the alley cats and they can throw their stones
were the flyest
were the underdogs in this world alone
were they just a game
were they tall dark skinny or
were too hot
were too lost in the fumes
were too young to fall asleep
were tripping in our hearts and its reckless and clumsy
were up to no good please dont tell our mamas
were your cousins late again
