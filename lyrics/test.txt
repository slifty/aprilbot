And thats no fool
And thats real
And thats when I say
And the anchor told me
And the axe comes early
And the beat in my face
And the city wakes
And the dead lay
And the eatin is good
And the feeling is
And the fist is a devil
And the garbage blows
And the horror
And the ideal confusion
And the jukebox
And the kids
And the kids sing
And the king must die
And the lime lights
And the man in the tree
And the price is sweet
And the sky to the sky
And the song I sings
And the terror
And the water withdrew
And the way she looked
And the windows tinted
And their babies cry
And then
And then I might
And then bites the dust
And then he says to me
And then it go boing
And then just leave me
And then one day
And then she started
And then shell go
And then they ask why
And then we grew up
And then while Im away
And then you were gone
And then
And there may not
And there was no pool
And theres no rest
And theres no time
And these fruits
And these shadows turn
And they aint the kind
And they all rise
And they doing the same
And they dress the same
And they feel the same
And they go on rocking
And they often imitate
And they say
And they turn me on
And they turn me on
And they was right
And they will pass
And theyre cursing me
And theyre drunk again
And theyre haunting me
And they
And thick as can be
And thick curls
And things you do
And this I promise you
And this game is Brian
And this is so hard
And this is the remix
And this one right here
And this tower is alive
And this year
And till it fills up
And time goes by
And to a lot of crap
And told me her name
And took his life away
And took our knives
And tore it apart
And tore me apart
And true
And two missing toes
And unlocks the door
And uplifts
And use my cell phone
And wait on me darling
And walk along the sand
And watch me heard you
And watch me rip
And we all get paid
And we all got problems
And we are grateful for
And we are all right

Art thou not human man
As I look to you
As I pulled away slowly
As I turn out the light
As I was growin up
As I watched her leave
As I wonder
As I write this letter
As Im doing my hair
As a Kid Rock clone
As a child I picked it
As a fugitive
As a lover and a friend
As does my time
As each day goes by
As far as I can see
As far can be
As he climbs he dares
As he reluctantly
As hes walking away
As her body once did
As high as a kite
As if I really care
As if I wasnt there
As if you blame
As it began
As it was so long ago
As long as theres
As my victims bleed
As sad as it may seem
As she climbs her way
As she looked up at me
As strange as it seems
As the Earth to the sun
As the bright blue sky
As the hating escalated
As thousands of rocks
As time crumbles away
As we watch the sunrise
As well as her
