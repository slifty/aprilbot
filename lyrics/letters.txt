one two three
uh and here we go

sending this message into space with my ray gun
hoping that important ears will hear this when the days done
so far its been great fun
you would swear ive been playing with myself
cause i been doing me since day one
they used to swear that i would never have a smash hit
now i see them haters doubletake no adlibs
cause what comes from his lips is crack chapstick
what im composing im singing mixing and writing bars
so i guess i make it easy to pick out my flaws
cause when one things crazy anothers subpar
so i guess i gotta make it work trtrtriple times as hard
the engineers will have my head is the mix is off
rappers will be coming at my neck if the  is wrong
singers keep telling me that i got a couple vocals flaws
but every single one of them is like yo your talents raw

i think im heading in the right direction
i think im heading in the right direction
i think im heading in the right direction
i think im heading in the right direction
ohoohohoohohoohohoh

a yeah first time listening to me
if you just popped a mixtape in or something
this is what i do i make feel good music
i guess dont expect anything more or less
i just make whatever i feel like making

so please dont try and save me
this is how my story ends
this keeps me from going crazy
so ill be writing till my death
im on my am flow and im chilling with these lights low

i think im heading in the right direction
i think im heading in the right direction
i think im heading in the right direction
i think im heading in the right direction
ohoohohoohohoohohoh

but yeah like i said
the label is beautiful mind
my name is jon bellion and the mixtape is scattered thoughts volume 
welcome hope you like it word
yo this beat is tough
i mean i made it but this beat is tough
i can say that

i came an hour late but you fled the scene

before anybodys trunk knocked
i was a skinny little italian
with nothing but a jump shot
and if i ever got a hot head
she would call up judy bellion
in a hot sec you bet

shes like a song so eclectic
and her eyes are like a string section
and her legs are like a electric guitar
and im hendrix
im tempted to shred along her frets kid

you get it
like shred along her frets
like a guitar reference cause her legs
like im basically explaining this right now
shes not even gonna be able to follow whats going on
and i think like i said before
thats what i like most about her
whats wrong with me

she sees past everything
no smoke no mirrors
to see me clearer
i think about wedding rings
and if she ever left this home
id have trouble breathing on my own
now i feel like you need to know
you gave wings gave wings to my soul

thank you dilla for your swing and pocket
and ridiculous you did that inspired me
and the roots you guys go without say

but she knows my heart

shes a lady when she shakes hands in the streets
but shes an animal once were up in the sheets
and i never win in mario kart cause she always cheats
oh but that is okay because shes dope
i have two parking tickets she has fortythree
and all my friends they love her she drinks more than me
and she really doesnt give a damn if i sing out of key
so baby what it look like youre so dope
uh and shes the definition of my everything
i want to tell her so many things
kick back now im thinking about a wedding ring

she so dope she so crazy

cause your hands have a hold on me

iii was trying to stick so close to the plan
couldnt find my heart than it rose from the sand
so i propose a toast east coast to japan
give you a massage for your soul in my hands
so much in common
she is mos def the stars to my comet
she so new age and far from the logic
that i cant find love and have it for eternity
pick it up now
she could rock the hippy look she so outta sight
im just glad i made the cut im so samurai
everything is cool with her she dont need no candlelight
dinner shes a winner we can kick it chill at tgi
fridays have a for but usually turns into 
who the hell is driving home guess we got a taxi ride

heres a meal for your thoughts food filled with spirit
never been affected by dudes who couldnt feel it
when im buried in the seam i choose to kill bill it
i make music for my own uses
never worry about approval from so called cool kids
used to reduce thoughts of who i influenced
now im all about a target hitting hearts like cupid
i from the land of breakbeats and skate decks
baselines and backpacks good tape and tape decks
making music from the heart
trying to separate the real from the fake
but was standing in the dark
they used to tell me where the honeys at
during their recording and i bought it
now im trying to get my money back
i cant say when me and soul departed
but im just trying to get back to where it started

unh since when did you grow up hello kitty always
was on your bags and your socks and cooties was always
my fear now youre all sex and the city on me
so grown so mature and so able bodied
to pay yo taxes take it back to class
when i didnt have no chapstick i was so average
you were so brighteyed and still believed in magic
we were so natural but now were so plastic
when did we grow up
lets smash the clock and slow up
but if i have to hear one more thing about your business career
i might just throw up
but you showed up
which so proved the old yous in there somewhere
so moved the old school into an only past
but lets open a new book as we go pass

im staring at old picture frames
i think i kinda miss your face
maybe we could spend the day
remember how we used to lay down
and you know you dont have as much fun with anyone else
and you know that this beer wont drink itself
hehehe oh oh

oh i took all your records
then smashed them on the floor
then i came up with this melody
till this baseline shook my floor
and after all the pain youve cause me
i see one things true true
oh this song
sounds like me getting over you

now if you with me stand up and just rock it
her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
this is a public service announcement for those whove fallen
and goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit

oh i took all your records
then smashed them on the floor
then i came up with this melody
till this baseline shook my floor
and after all the pain youve cause me
i see one things true true
oh this song
sounds like me getting over you

like jersey shore im sure ive missed
cause im turning heartbreaking to hits
hit the reset button on the play back
im just amazed that you can erase that
asap out of your mind its like ajax
cause you wipe me clean baby eight stacks
couldnt pay for this lesson learned
when i hit the dance floor baby heads will turn
cause im looking good turn to my bottle and kissed it
cause a drink looks a lot better than your lipstick

now if you with me stand up and just rock it
her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
this is a public service announcement for those whove fallen
and goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit

everything to her children three jobs just for living

she was my copilot with a mile high swag
i needed her i know she needed me
if we fly this thing its gonna take two people
but the storm came fast
got a little rocky the oxygen mask from the ceiling they were dropping

we started to fall right out the sky
without a warning call nahhoo
we started to fall no parachute so we had no time to call for mayday mayday
we bought two tickets and and a paradise
one last flight trying make it right
but thats when the rain came
thats when the pain came
were never ever gonna make it far
we bought two tickets and a paradise
one last flight tryna make it right
but love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane
i know we tried to fly away but we were just a
paper plane

its funny how things end up
its funny how we break it off
relationships they nose dive
while ones career is taking off
publishing checks and fake smiles as i see my dad
my pockets getting filled
but really emptiness is all i have
we crash and now theres spare parts
bandages and bad scars
we try to mend broke amelia earharts
and keep trying to fly on fly on fly on
but im missing my right wing
my right arm and thats you

we started to fall right out the sky
without a warning call nahhoo
we started to fall no parachute so we had no time to call for mayday mayday
we bought two tickets and and a paradise
one last flight trying make it right
but thats when the rain came
thats when the pain came
were never ever gonna make it far
we bought two tickets and a paradise
one last flight trying make it right
but love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane
i know we tried to fly away but we were just a
paper plane

then he would do it all by himself
but i dont think he got strength to muster
and he dont got a lot lack of lustre

but he will he will he will yes he will

to wander through alleys and look at the bars

the headlights from passing cars

they swing till youre tired and send you to mars

making decisions shorty good things dont last long
your girlfriend keep showin me that thong

it gets annoying from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know well be friends and nothing more
she loves it when im in town
hate it when im not around
i get her and wear down
next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hittin the ground
just enough to hold us down
im stickin n moving cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a  year old feel like a young lady

i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call me by my government name
her panties wet over fame
fall in love with my chain
i wonder if i wasnt an entertainer would she remain
surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
im not your boyfriend im your homie

watching her lick her lips
i sweet talking her if she like
look im legit now used to break laws
now you can reap the benefit of world tours
big house big benz girl it yours
mink coats italian shoes stones with no flaws

all you gotta do is love me and be loyal
cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you

i got something to say
a confession of me
ive been led astray
tried so hard to change
but im set on my ways
my words mean nothing again

i promised id be good
but i cant help myself from these temptations
when they come theres nothing i can do
i promised id be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall i will fall to you

i promised id be good
i promised id be good

i just couldnt resist
it was the moment of bliss
i know its hard to forgive
its too late for changes
all this time ive wasted
words mean nothing nothing again

i promised id be good
but i cant help myself from these temptations
when they come theres nothing i can do
i promised id be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall i will fall to you

i promised id be good
i promised id be good

i promised id be good
but i cant help myself from these temptations
when they come theres nothing i can do
i promised id be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall i will fall to you

i promised id be good
but i cant help myself from these temptations
when they come theres nothing i can do
i promised id be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall i will fall to you

fighting flames of fire
hang onto burning wires

we keep wasting colors
maybe we should let this go

weve passed the end so we chase forever
cause this is all we know
this feelings all we know

down the streets right through the city
ill go everywhere you go
from chicago to the coast

blow the smoke right through the window
cause this is all we know

cause this is all we know
cause this is all we know
cause this is all we know

two hearts still beating
on with different rhythms
maybe we should let this go

were falling apart still we hold together
weve passed the end so we chase forever
cause this is all we know
this feelings all we know

ill ride my bike up to the road
down the streets right through the city
ill go everywhere you go
from chicago to the coast

story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company

hes more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in
because im gone again
and to him i just cant be true

and i know that he knows im unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying

i dont wanna do this anymore
i dont wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i dont wanna hurt him anymore
i dont wanna take away his life
i dont wanna be a murderer

i feel it in the air
as im doing my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek
as he reluctantly
ask if im gonna be out late

i say i wont be long
just hanging with the girls
a lie i didnt have to tell
because we both know
where im about to go
and we know it very well

cause i know that he knows im unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying

i dont wanna do this anymore
i dont wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i dont wanna hurt him anymore
i dont wanna take away his life
i dont wanna be a murderer

our love
his trust
i might as well take a gun and put it to his head
get it over with
i dont wanna do this anymore
ooh
anymore

i dont wanna do this anymore
i dont wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i dont wanna hurt him anymore
i dont wanna take away his life
i dont wanna be a murderer

a murderer
no no no
yeah yeah yeah

visions in my mind
of the day that we met
you showed me things
that ill never forget

took me swimming
in the ocean
you had my head up in the clouds
made me feel like im floating
you think im playing

when you know its the truth
nobody else can do it quite like i do
all my kisses
and my loving
but aint nobody better than us

now i look back on the time
that we spent and i
see it in my mind
playing over and over again
cause boy right now
you got me breaking down
and i just cant figure out why

but you and i know
its not that easy to let go
of everything that we planned
and start all over again

just blame yourself cause you blew it
i wont forget how you do it

im not concerned with people

see them try to mess to hurt you
and work you

not letting them know how much you struggle
they turn green with envy when your on top
and dem heart is full with strife
their by gonna try to take your life

ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
dont be fooled you betta recognize
they not there for you
they dont care for you
trust me cause i know its true
ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
then they turn against you when your not around
its just jealousy and dishonesty
so hold on to your sanity


i never should of waited so long to say

thought that you would stay forever with me
but the time has come to leave

before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
ill tell you a secret ive held all my life
its you that i live for and for you i die
so ill lay here with you till the final goodbye

hold draw me close close to my lips
listen intently as i tell you this
outside the world wages its rewards ill rest in peace as long as you know

before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
ill tell you a secret ive held all my life
its you that i live for and for you i die
so ill lay here with you till the final goodbye

promise you our love will carry on
until you turn eternal we belong

before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
ill tell you a secret ive held all my life
its you that i live for and for you i die
so ill lay here with you till the final goodbye

here we lay face to face once again
the silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
and im wondering who will be the first
to say what we both know
were just holding on to could have beens
and we should be letting go

it feels like youre a million miles away
i cant even find the words to say
i can find a way to make it right
and we both know that the storys ending
we play the part but were just pretending
and i can hide the tears
cause even though youre here
it feels like youre a million miles away

was it me or was it you that broke away
from what we were just like the seasons love has changed
and every i think about it
it tears me up inside
like the rivers of emotion but i got no more tears to cry


we can try to talk it over
but we walked that road before
boy our song has played its last note
and we both know for sure
that its time to close that door

how can i climb inside you
the way that youre climbing inside me
how could i ever deny you
the way that you never deny me
how can i climb inside you
touching the parts that people really see
how can i open and find you
and feel you the way that you want me to feel

i want you to know what im thinking of
i want you to read my mind before i write it
i want you to know that i have stories to tell
i wanna tell you a little bit more

how do i get to align with you
if we can piece together something
or something else that will be

cant believe that youre less
im still not against your will
a change that you really want too
if i pour it all out
will you still have no doubt
theres a reason or two that you are too

your insensitivity is your personality
a trade thats least favourite
ha ha funny you think youre so funny
but you hurt my feelings
weve had some good dealings
what have i done recently to make you so mean to me
im oversensitive you say but i think youre nasty today
you make me feel nasty like a control freak
i just want to feel helpful like im needed
a sense of reason
look how long it took
ive been like this all the time
you dont know what its like to be me 
youre not paranoid neurotic  youre free
i dont like me much anymore
you make me feel a burden
you make me feel like a bore


well i live here with you
in in a kind of yes will do
oh what part of now dont you understand
im showing you well apparent
yeah i get the bluff if ill get out
no room for three you me and your doubts
one of us has got to leave
and itll sure be me

and i think we could have a situation
we could have a situation

any reason we cant just settle around now
yeah ok and how
rather than shout and praise
oh what part of our old tune dont you understand
i think i made it clear that youre in the mend
in the mend

oh we could have a situation
oh we could have a situation


yes you can take that to heart
it was meant to sit close to the bone anyway
you can make it a big issue
make it a battle of your own and thats ok

you can feign a distant familiarity
you say you understand the similarity
you think you see me with great clarity
but youre acting me not necessarily

only if you steal my shadow will you truly know

yes you can call that a start
it was meant to begin kind of slow anyway
yes your deceit is an art
i knew you would sink kind of low anyway

you say you have the best intentions
you fill me with fickle suggestions
logic is fired by inventions
but your concern is much more than you mention

only if you steal my shadow will you truly know

you say you know my situation
you say youve been confused by my complication
you think my soul makes negotiation
but you dont see my hesitation

only if you steal my shadow will you truly know

i sometimes believe that everything i dream
will one day be my reality
i sometimes think that every move i make
will gather in shape in my reality

i can only dream
i can only hope
that one day i will see
a beautiful reality
i can only wish
and i can only want
that one day i will see
a beautiful reality

i sometimes search for signs my dreams can work
until i stand alert with my reality
i sometimes look in paradise by the book
to give back what i took from my reality

i can only dream
i can only hope
that one day i will see
a beautiful reality
i can only wish
and i can only want
that i will one day see

like a new winters coat
im wearing your last embrace
like a cold quenching glass of water
i hold a clear picture of your face

where are you
soon ill be cold and thirsty
soon ill be cold and thirsty

im hearing your last telephone call
ringing louder and clearer than the rest
i hear your invitation to see it all
better written i am smitten no protest

where are you
soon ill be bored and lonely
soon ill be bored and lonely

like a story well told
your conversation can hold me or soothe me
like a funny time to share you were there
and your comfort and support me

where are you
soon ill be restless and weary
soon ill be restless and weary

like another man
i want hold you within me
like a good day without care
i just want you to last
i just want you to last

im tasting the last glass of your wine
the sweet taste linger left on lips
i think of your kisses with mine
the sweet taste lingers left on lips

where are you
soon ill be sober and unkissed
soon ill be sober and unkissed


i i i never would have thought it would end this way i lied
i never have believed that we would separate
what we have now is how it stands
and now i wish youll try to make it stay
the way we are is here and now
i wish youd make the most of all we have today

before you go and give it away
hold on for one more shot
before you let it slip away
hold on for one more shot

i did not believe i did not mean to hurt you no more
i never meant to let you down down
though the silver lining wears through
i still do not mean to hurt you no
when the sound of your voice is not ringing through
beginning to question whether i should be around

before you go and give it away
hold on for one more shot
before you let it slip away
hold on for one more shot

before you go and give it away
hold on for one more shot
before you let it slip away
hold on for one more shot


my mothers afraid of the subway
its a living bad dream
i hold her hand as the doors close
and she pales and stifles a scream

alis afraid of adlibbing
of improvising at jams
she is not very happy right now
and spends all her money on grams

ade is afraid of commitment
so carla dumped him today
she is very disappointed
she was hoping hed beg her to stay

ayo he just wants a girlfriend
hes afraid of dying alone
he doesnt go out very much
sits at home a lot getting stoned

you see fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear it is fear it is fear

ella is worried about her weight
she wont eat in public anymore
when theyve finished she sleeps on the floor

nate has a heart of gold
but give it away he will not
his mother abandoned him at ten
its a pain he has never forgot

marys afraid of herself
her sentences often cut half
she will never give her own opinion
shes afraid that people might laugh

and i am afraid of sharks
i will not swim out past my head
and sometimes i worry my boyfriend will die
my first love is already dead

you see fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear it is fear it is fear

you see fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear it is fear it is fear

candy is having a baby
she fears she will be like her mom
her friends say relax take a deep breath
and march to a different drum

sachas afraid of her marco
she thinks that its all her fault
but if he did what he does to a stranger
hed be locked up and charged with assault

you see fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear it is fear it is fear


eat food to satisfy my hunger
i drink water to quench my thirst
use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
and prick with pin to watch it burst
to make noise i use my breathe
to unlock doors i use a key
when im looking for something i use my eyes
use booze to unlock me

sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep

wear shoes so i can run
as to avoid the broken glass
wear the pants because they suit me
and to discourage the pinchin of ass
ill tell a joke to make you laugh
ill close the door to have a cry
they say that change and pain is a positive thing
have i changed since you died

sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep

dont ask my why i smoke i dont know

you see i do what i say and i say what i do
is it too much to expect that you could
i wish you would

i aint waiting for you no more
i aint waiting for you
i aint waiting for you no more
go find another fool
i aint waiting for you no more
i aint waiting for you
i aint waiting for you no more

i aint missing nothing for you
i aint waiting for you no more
i aint waiting for you
i aint waiting for you no more
go find another fool


without a sound ever heard
without a lesson ive learned
youre foolish
and diluted

too many lies have you burned
where theres eyes to be found
this seems lifes underground

but even if you had it all
you would find
i could never let you stay

cause you blow it all away
blow it all away
blow it all away

if you go
i will stall

yes i see it
yes i feel it
you have no questions at all

but if life is truly devoured
ill strip your bare til truth comes out

but even if you had it all
you would find
you blow it all

you blow it all away
blow it all away
blow it all away

forever is your mind to be naive
remember
it will bring us to our knees
you blow it all away

cause even if you had it all
you would find
you blow it all

you blow it all away
blow it all away
blow it all away


now i dont mind if you find that im a shoulder to cry on rely on
but the burden is just too much im losing touch with myself and my health

what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me
what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me

now i dont keep you from your sleep i need some ease im tired of trying to please
and it seems that my dreams are coming farther and fewer in between

what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me
what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me


you took me for granted
you took me you took me for granted
but i landed back on my feet back on
my feet
cause you dont deserve me deserve me
you dont have the time that i need
that i want i deserve
but i got back my nerve
did what was right for me
im using my head not my heart
and im starting new
im going to get over you over you

im not important to you
im not important to you
im not important to you
im not important to you

you happy is all i wanted to see is all
i wanted to see to see
and so now thats what
im going to be what im going to be
ill waste some time on me
i gave you my all and you took it
i saw and you gave nothing back
your mind on another track
another track another track yeah
there are plenty of people out there
who would care about me
youll see
youll see

im not important to you
im not important to you
im not important to you
im not important to you


like a new winters coat
im wearing your last embrace
like cool quenching glass of water
i hold a clear picture of your face

oh when are you coming around
oh when are you coming around
cause soon ill be cold and thirsty
oh when are you coming around
oh when are you coming around
cause soon ill be cold and thirsty

im hearing your last telephone call
ringing louder and clearer than the rest
i hear your invitation to see it all
better written i am smitten no protest

oh when are you coming around
oh when are you coming around
cause soon ill be bored and lonely
oh when are you coming around
oh when are you coming around
cause soon ill be bored and lonely

im tasting the last glass of your wine
the sweet taste lingers left on lips
im tasting your sweet kisses with mine
the sweet taste lingers left on lips

so when are you coming around
oh when are you coming around
cause soon ill be sober and unkissed
oh when are you coming around
oh when are you coming around
cause soon ill be sober and unkissed

oh when are you coming around

healing is difficult
often results in psychosomatic
i admit to enjoying drugs
they get rid of tension boredom and static
hate those adverse side effects
forcing the people who love me to scatter
excuse me for being such a hypocrite
the way i see it really doesnt matter

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

to tell you the truth
i cant believe i love you so much
so much in fact that i dont know whether to weep or wind my watch
i have a sick sense of humor
it amazes me how points it scores
im addicted to vice
my best friends are pushers my boyfriends are whores

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

simple to see why i breathe
no one bothers me completely

simple to see why i breathe
no one bothers me completely

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

waking up next to you
your morning breath reminds me of lucy
the flies in the front room
buzz round my head and try to seduce me
if i contract illness
the last thing i want is to pass it to others
when i start forgetting the names of my lovers

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

making you suffer
wondering how you got your scars

i wish i had taken you in my arms

taken you in my arms
taken you in my arms
taken you in my arms
taken you in my arms

you turned that around on me

she cooks you sweet potato you dont like aubergine
she knows to boil the kettle when you hum bars from grease
she senses you are lonely but still she cant be sure
and so she stands and waits stands anticipating your thoughts

how can she become the psychic that she longs to be
to understand you
how can she become the psychic that she longs to be
to understand you

he brushes thoroughly
he knows she likes fresh breath
he rushes to the station
he waits atop the steps
hes brought with a mars bar
she will not buy nestle
and later hell perform
a lovelorn serenade a trade

how can he become the psychic that he longs to be
to understand you
how can he become the psychic that he longs to be
to understand you

so give her information to help her fill her holes
give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled
help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in
give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin

now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest
i am a martyr and a victim and i need to be caressed
i hate that you negate me im a ghost at beck and call
im fading and placating berate myself for staying

im a fool
im a fool

he greets this stranger meekly a thing that she accepts
she sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps

im sipping pink
lucozade
were blazing on that new found haze
im seeing in the blacks and grays
im hoping that the basket sways
does that make it right for smoke
seeing the pain inside in this house of fear

you dont even wanna know about the things i hear
im just wishing its ambition that got you
your position
youll be fishing for far too long
youre the bad guy in this movie
and i aint wrong i dont breathe the pollution
and it aint about whos winning or losing

its bout the path youre choosing
time heals pain and promotes selfsoothing
when the scars are gone you cant see bruising
wanna take these watches chains and gold rings
im getting caught up in the feelings that they bring
a lack of sanity losing touch with reality
smoking too much its starting to fog up my clarity
traveling in the day but youre still looking far to me

bulls eye you the dot to me
emotions splattered same pattern
cant even begin to spot em
no lies in my eyes nothing but truth will leave my mouth

shes older i told her
we aint meant to be
it takes two not three but im here any way
i hope hes leaving soon
started not to see the elephant in this room
disguise is your perfume
but the smell of it consumes it takes all my mind

i see everything youve done to me
be there you run to me
i dont need to pace i dont need the stamina
kept runnin
outwit cause you cunnin

begging cause im losing mage

remember when we swam in the ocean
now we know whats deep inside
remember when we ran in the open
now we know whats in the wild
used to think that this love was heaven sent
how did we get lost cant get back again
tell me is there light on the outside

so are we leaving this garden of eden
are we leaving this garden of eden

used to walk around your apartment
with nothing but a smile on me
isnt it so clear to see
nothings ever perfect in paradise
dont know what its worth till you pay the price
when you bite your tongue does it draw blood

so are we leaving this garden of eden
are we leaving this garden of eden
now i know what i know
but its hard to find the meaning
where do we go
cause we dont believe in this garden of eden
this garden of eden

i have cried for you and ill ride for you
i would die for you would you do that for me
tell the truth what you wanna do
is it me and you

tell the truth what you wanna do
is it me and you

maybe one day i can see you
we can smile and wave and itll be okay
maybe one day itll be cool
we could just be friends without the complications that it brings
when we start saying things
yeah i hurt you and you hurt me
yeah we did some things that we can never take back
and we tried hard just to fix it
but we broke it more
and so i guess some things are not meant to last
is it too much to ask

why dont we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh

in a dark room
we dont have to see the light of truth between me and you
we can stay blind in the meantime
let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
even though its too late

why dont we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh
no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh

maybe one day ill see you
just smile and wave and be okay

lets love like theres no goodbyes
why dont we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh
no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh

we could just be friends without the complications that it brings
when we start saying things

and we tried hard just to fix it
but we broke it more
and so i guess some things are not meant to last
is it too much to ask

why dont we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh

in a dark room
we dont have to see the light of truth between me and you
we can stay blind in the meantime
let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
even though its too late

why dont we hold each other use each other whisper pretty lies

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh
no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes eh

used to walk around your apartment
with nothing but a smile on me
isnt it so clear to see
nothings ever perfect in paradise
dont know what its worth till you pay the price
when you bite your tongue does it draw blood

but its hard to find the meaning
where do we go
cause we dont believe in this garden of eden
this garden of eden

now we know whats deep inside
remember when we ran in the open

so are we leaving
are we leaving
now i know what i know
but its hard to find the meaning

and in the limelight
i play it off fine

young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

the life is fading from me
while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

remember the time
we jumped the fence when
the stones were playing and we were too broke to get in
you held my hand and
they made me cry while
or when you took me
across the world we
promised that this would last forever but now i see
it was my past life
a beautiful time
drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

oh oh oh oh
drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

they say that true love hurts
well this could almost kill me
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

they say that true love hurts
well this could almost kill me
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

he said the way my blue eyes shined
i said thats a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin stuck

and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

september saw a month of tears
and thankin god that you werent here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back

its hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
and lookin back on all of that its nice to believe

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

and im back for the first time since then
im standin on your street
and theres a letter left on your doorstep

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday youll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
oh think of me mmm

he said the way my blue eyes shine
i said thats a lie


state the obvious i didnt get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that im obsessive and crazy
thats fine ill tell mine youre gay
by the way

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

theres no time for tears
im just sitting here planning my revenge
theres nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

and if youre missing me youd better keep it to yourself
cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you havent heard i really really hate that

stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

burn burn burn baby burn
youre just another picture to burn
baby burn

ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about
and shes got everything that i have to live without

i laugh cause its so damn funny
that i cant even see anyone when hes with me
he says hes so in love hes finally got it right

hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do

drew walks by me
can he tell that i cant breathe
and there he goes so perfectly the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause

hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
ill put his picture down

cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do

hes the time taken up but theres never enough
and hes all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he wont see


i dont know what i want
so dont ask me
cause im still trying to figure it out
dont know whats down this road
im just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though im not the only one
who feels the way i do

im alone
on my own
and thats all i know
ill be strong
ill be wrong
oh but life goes on
oh im just a girl
trying to find a place in this world

got the radio on
my old blue jeans
and im wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today

could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrows just a mystery
oh yeah but thats okay

im alone
on my own
and thats all i know
ill be strong
ill be wrong
oh but life goes on
oh im just a girl

oh im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

oh im just a girl
oh im just a girl
oh im just a girl


you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take you take the very best of me
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want cause im not what you wanted

oh what a shame
what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day
just walk away
aint no use defending words that you will never say
and now that im sitting here thinking it through
ive never been anywhere cold as you

you put up walls
and paint them all a shade of grey
and i stood there loving you
and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

oh what a shame
what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day
so just walk away
aint no use defending words that you will never say
and now that im sitting here thinking it through
ive never been anywhere cold as you

you never did give a damn thing honey
but i cried cried for you
and i know you wouldnt have told nobody
if i died died for you died for you

oh what a shame
what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day
oh every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
and now that im sitting here thinking it through
ive never been anywhere cold as you


i didnt know
what i would find
when i went lookin for a reason
i know
i didnt read
between the lines
and baby ive got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right

so how can i ever
try to be better
nobody ever
lets me in
and i can still see you
this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been a lot of lonely places
ive never been on the outside

you saw me there
but never knew
that i would give it all just to be
a part of this
a part of you
and now its all too late
so you see
you could have helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until its too late to do anything

so how can i ever
try to be better
nobody ever
lets me in
and i can still see you
this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been a lot of lonely places
ive never been on the outside

oh yeah
how can i ever
try to be better
nobody ever
lets me in
and i can still see you
this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been a lot of lonely places
ive never been on the outside

oh oh
ah oh oh
oh oh
oh oh


seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking youre not pretty
but thats not true cause i know you

hold on baby youre losing it
the waters high and youre jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you dont tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone

i guess its true that love was all you wanted
cause youre giving it away like its extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh cause its not his price to pay
its not his price to pay

hold on baby youre losing it
the waters high and youre jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you dont tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone

hold on baby youre losing it
the waters high and youre jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you dont tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone
youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone

goodbye baby
with a smile
baby baby oh

its strange to think
the songs we used to sing
the smiles
the flowers
everything is gone

yesterday i found out about you
even though im just looking at you
feels wrong
you say that youd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me

you can see that ive been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same
you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me

oh i cant resist
before you go
tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this
no no no no no

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me


she said i was seven and you were nine

and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my

took me back to the house and the backyard trees

i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids
you and i
oh my my my

well i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasnt that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined
like pretty lights
and our daddys used to joke about the two of us
they never believed wed really fall in love
and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my

took me back to the creek beds we turned up
two am running in your truck
and all i need is you next to me
took me back to the time we had our very first fight
you stayed outside
till the morning light
oh my my my

a few years have gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me
got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came
and our mamas cried

and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
well rock our babies on the very front porch
after all this time
you and i

ill be eighty seven
youll be eighty nine
ill still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky
oh my my my

in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we dont say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i dont wanna live without you

im only up when youre not down
dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
its like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half im only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and im only me when im with you

just a small town boy and girl
livin in a crazy world
tryin to figure out what is and isnt true
and i dont try to hide my tears
the secrets all my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you cant live without me

im only up when youre not down
dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
its like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half im only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and im only me when im with you

when im with anybody else
its so hard to be myself
only you can see

im only up when youre not down
dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
its like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half im only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and im only me who i wanna be
well im only me when im with you
with you


she cant see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
shell never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by
and you cant see me wantin you the way you want her
but you are everything to me

and i just wanna show you
she dont even know you
shes never gonna love you
like i want to
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
instead of just invisible

theres a fire inside of you
that cant help but shine through
shes never gonna see the light
no matter what you do
and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be

i just wanna show you
she dont even know you
shes never gonna love you
like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
instead of just invisible

like shadows in a faded light
oh were invisible
i just wanna look in your eyes
and make you realise

i just wanna show you
she dont even know you
baby let me love you
let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
instead of just invisible

she cant see the way your eyes
light up when you smile


why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

maybe i shouldve seen the signs
shouldve read the writing on the wall
and realised by the distance in your eyes
that i would be the one to fall

no matter what you say
i still cant believe
that you would walk away

why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

its not unbroken anymore
how do i get it back the way it was before

why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar

why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart


hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is taylor swift and have you heard this song yet

i have heard this song

tim mcgraw and what what did you think the first time you heard it or how was the first time

it was awesome uh except for i didnt know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old

laughs

i didnt know which one but the more the more i hear it the more i dont know if its true or not but i start taking it as a compliment and not that i feel that im old i dont know if thats true but thats what i choose to think

why dont we find out taylor is a compliment or uh hes old

oh its definitely a compliment yeah

laughs

tim mcgraw meet taylor swift

nice

nice to meet you

nice to meet you taylor how you doing

im doing great how are you doing

im doing good congratulations on your record its doing great

thank you so much im just so excited thank you for uh having good music and everything i swear im not a stalker

laughs

well

the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like  hours youll do them writing a song and itll be good and everything but i wrote this one in literally  minutes and ya know i really didnt think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so i kinda shelved it for like  months and never even thought that it was going to be a single but um my label heard it and was like were putting that out

laughs

well im glad ya did cause um its doing well for ya

so i
so i understand that you two guys have not talked

no

you havent met

no

no weve never talked or met or anything

i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh i dont remember what show it was i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so i sent her a little message so i dont know if she got it or not

oh my god they never gave that to me

they didnt okay well there ya go i did

laughs

so ii

weve just officially never never talked or messaged or anything

not at all

so i thought i think its pretty brave to put out a song called tim mcgraw without maybe talking to tim mcgraw did you mind

it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i didnt say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldnt take it too bad

well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad im sure theres plenty that couldve been said tell me

could you tell faith that i said hello

i sure will i sure will and she loves the song too by the way

oh my gosh shes awesome

i agree

this this tell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen

well yeah i mean i never really kinda went into this writing session on im gonna write a song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um

laughs

i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school

now i feel old

and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me and its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are

aww thank you

and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out all right and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like  months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well thats your first single

ill give it to someone special

once bitten and twice shy
i keep my distance but you still catch my eye
tell me baby do you recognize me
well its been a year it doesnt surprise me

merry christmas  i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying i love you i meant it
now i know what a fool ive been
but if you kissed me now i know youd fool me again

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
ill give it to someone special

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
ill give it to someone special

a crowded room and friends with tired eyes
im hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god i thought you were someone to rely on
me i guess i was a shoulder to cry on

a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl under cover but you tore her apart
maybe this year maybe this year
ill give it to someone special

cause last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
ill give it to someone special

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
ill give it to someone special

and last christmas
and this year
it wont be anything like anything like

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year to save me from tears
ill give it to someone special


please take down the mistleoe

in a snow covered little town
mamas in the kitchen worrying about me
seasons greetings hope youre well

i know this shouldnt be a lonely time
but there were christmases when you were mine

ive been doing fine without you really

but for me its just a lonely time
cause there were christmases when you were mine

merry christmas everynbody

i know this shouldnt be a lonely time
but there were christmases whe i didnt


santa baby slip a sable under the tree for me
ive been an awful good girl santa baby

santa baby a  convertible too light blue
well ill wait up for you dear santa baby

think of all the fun ive missed
think of all the boys i havent kissed
next year i could be just as good
if you check off my christmas list

santa baby i want a yacht and really thats not a lot
ive been an angel all year santa baby

santa honey theres one more thing i really do need the deed
to a platinum mine santa honey

with some decorations bought at tiffanys

all is calm and all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

shepherds quake at the sight
glories stream from heaven afar
heavenly hosts sing halleluia
christ the savior is born
christ our savior is born

son of god
loves pure light
radiant beams from thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace
jesus lord at thy birth
jesus lord at thy birth

halleluia
halleluia
halleluia

christ the savior is born


what if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing
would the song stil survive without  golden rings
would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
what would happen if god never let it snow
what would happen if christmas carols told a lie
tell me what you would find

youd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
its something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so heres something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more

what if angels did not pay attention to
all the things that we wish they would always do
what if happiness came in a cardboard box
then id think there was somethingwe all forgot
what would happenif presents all went away
tell me what would you find

youd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
its something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so heres something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more

we get so caught up in all of it
business and relationships
 mile an hour lives
and its this time of year
and everybodys here
it seems the last thing on your mind

youd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so heres to jesus christ who saved our lives
its something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so heres something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something
christmas must be something
christmas must be something more
theres gotta be more


im dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
where the tree tops glisten and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow

im dreaming of a white christmas
with every christmas card i write
may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white

im dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
so may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white

may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white


your beautiful eyes
stare right into my eyes

i dont know why
i want to be somewhere where you are
i want to be where

youre here your eyes are looking into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
im looking through your
im looking through your eyes

i wake up im alive
in only a little while i cry
cause youre my lullaby
so baby come hold me tight cause i  i
i want to be everything you need
i want to be where

youre here your eyes are looking into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before

just as long as youre mine
let me love you kiss you
oh baby let me miss you
let me see your
dream about
dream about
dream about your eyes
eyes eyes beautiful eyes


its strange to think
the songs we used to sing
the smiles
the flowers
everything is gone

yesterday i found out about you
even though im just looking at you
feels wrong
you say that youd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me

you can see that ive been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same
you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me

oh i cant resist
before you go
tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this
no no no no no

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me


drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he wont see
that i want and im needing everything that we should be
ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about
and shes got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me
i laugh cause its so damn funny
that i cant even see anyone when hes with me
he says hes so in love hes finally got it right

hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do

drew walks by me
can he tell that i cant breathe
and there he goes so perfectly the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause

hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
ill put his picture down

cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do

hes the time taken up but theres never enough
and hes all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he wont see

i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that im obsessive and crazy
thats fine ill tell mine youre gay
by the way

youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

im just sitting here planning my revenge
theres nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

and if youre missing me youd better keep it to yourself
cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you havent heard i really really hate that

stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

my daddy says that life comes at you fast
we all like blades of grass
we come to prime and in time we just wither away
and it all changes
my view with a looking glass wont catch the past
only photographs remind us of the passing of days
oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
see i recall being afraid of the dark
and holding on to teddy bears
id wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
that was then and now im here

so hear me scream
i was too young to understand what it means
i couldnt wait till i could be seventeen
i thought he lied when he said take my time to breathe
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
im seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
seventeen
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen

my mother said dont forget where you come from where youve been
always keep your closest friends they cant slip away
they keep you grounded
oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice
and yeah i guess that sounded nice when i was ten
oh but never were there truer words
and ill my days ive ever heard
and when she told me little girl the answer is love
so those are words that i keep with me
though the seasons change so quickly
keep them buried in my heart
and never fought

so hear me scream
i was too young to understand what it means
i couldnt wait till i could be seventeen
i thought she lied when she said take your time to breathe
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
im seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen

im a know it all i dont know enough
see i was racing and waiting for the day that i would be old enough
guess ill be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough

i was too young to understand what it means
i couldnt wait till i could be seventeen
i thought she lied when she said take your time to breathe
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

but since my friends are here i just came to kick it
but really i would rather be at home all by myself
not in this room with people who dont even care about my well being
i dont dance dont ask i dont need a boyfriend
so you can go back please enjoy your party
ill be here somewhere in the corner
under clouds of marijuana with this boy whos hollerin
and i can hardly hear

so tell my friends that ill be over here

oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself what am i doin here
oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
and i cant wait til we can break up out of here

excuse me if i seem a little unimpressed with this
an antisocial pessimist but usually i dont mess with this
and i know you mean only the best and your
intentions arent to bother me but honestly id rather be
somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen to
and well discuss our big dreams how we plan to take over the planet
not there in the kitchen
with the girl whos always gossipin about her friends
oh tell them ill be here
cause he cant take whats in his cup no more
oh god why am i here

oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself what am i doin here
oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
and i cant wait til we can break up out of here

hours later congregatin next to the refrigerator

and im done talkin awfully sad it had to be that way
so tell my people when theyre ready that im ready
and im standin by the tv with my beanie low

some nerve you have
to break up my lonely
and tell me you want me
how dare you march into my heart
oh how rude of you
to ruin my miserable
and tell me im beautiful
cause i wasnt looking for love no
nobody asked to get me attached to you
in fact you tricked me
and i wasnt trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
so all that im asking
is that you handle me with caution
cause i dont give myself often
but i guess ill try today

cause ive had my heart
broken before
and i promised i would never let me hurt anymore
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby im yours

im mad at you
for being so cute
and changing my mood
and altering my rude
whats wrong with you
you make me sick for being so perfect
what did i do
what can i do oh
and i wasnt trying
to melt this heart of iron
but the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
and i would be lying
if i said i wasnt scared to fall again
but if you promise me youll catch me
then its okay

cause ive had my heart
broken before
and i promised i would never let me hurt anymore
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby im yours

oh i hate that i
spend my days just wasting time day dreaming till i see you again
im not used to this
oh i used to be so used to boys just using me
for you to be you to me
feels new to me
cause i usually cheer for the bad side
love under a bad sign
so it makes me mad im
falling again
falling again

but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
oh baby im yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby im yours
oh baby im yours


i grew up memorizing all the cracks in the wall
staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
see i prayed every day for a change to be made
and id wait to be saved oh no
shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
see i knew i was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing

i assumed there was only room for
my dreams in my dreams so id sleep and repeat til the moon went home
and i didnt know where itd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

then the universe aligned
with what i had in mind
who knew there was a life
behind those four pink walls

now i wake up to a different bedroom everyday
living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
used to sit and watch paint dry
amazed by the limelight
i cant ever be afraid

i assumed there was only room for
my dreams in my dreams so id sleep and repeat til the moon went home
and i didnt know where itd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

then the universe aligned
oh with what i had in mind
who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls
oh the universe aligned
with what i wanted all this time
i knew there was a life
behind those four pink walls

all of the days that i wasted gazing outside the window
impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
and i wondered why
things werent different
went from when boredom strikes to ms star on the rise
it was all in an instant man
but those four pink walls now i kinda miss them man

then the universe aligned
with what i wanted all this time
i knew there was a life
behind those four pink walls


to me where the wild things are is a place that exists in our minds its a place of liberty and shamelessness it can take a split second of our lifetime to find it but once you do youll be free

find table spaces
say your social graces
bow your head theyre pious here
but you and i were pioneers
we make our own rules
our own room no bias here
let em sell what they are sellin
there are no buyers here
so gather all the rebels now
well rebel rouse and sing aloud
we dont care what they say no way no way
and we will leave the empty chairs
to those who say we cant sit there
were fine all by ourselves

so aye we brought our drum and this is how we dance
no mistakin we make our breaks if you dont like our s
then leave us alone cause we dont need your policies
we have no apologies for being

find me where the wild things are
oh my well be all right
dont mind us
find me where the wild things are
oh my well be just fine
dont mind us yeah
find me where the wild things are

i lose my balance on these eggshells
you tell me to tread id rather be a wild one instead
dont wanna hang around the in crowd
the cool kids arent cool to me
theyre not cooler than we are

so aye we brought our drum and this is how we dance
no mistakin we make our breaks if you dont like our s
then leave us alone cause we dont need your policies
we have no apologies for being

find me where the wild things are
oh my well be all right
dont mind us yeah
find me where the wild things are
oh my well be just fine
ayeayeaye dont mind us

we will carve our place into time and space
we will find our way or well make a way say hey hey hey
find youre great dont you hide your face
and let it shine shine shine shine

so aye we brought our drum and this is how we dance
no mistakin we make our breaks if you dont like our s
then leave us alone cause we dont need your policies
we have no apologies for being

find me where the wild things are
oh my well be all right
dont mind us yeah
find me where the wild things are
oh my well be just fine
dont mind us yeah
find me where the wild things are

theres a wild thing that exists in all of us it lives in our passions and the people we love in our subconscious thoughts our beliefs its even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we cant be scared of it we have to become it


so much on my mind
i think i think too much
read between these lines
unspoken weight of words
but time comes to rest when you are by my side
it blurs

and i will follow where this takes me
and my tomorrows long to be unknown
when all is shaken be my safety
in a world uncertain say youll be my stone

change in every wind
the sands of time dont know our name
oh nothings sure but surely as we stand
i promise i will stay the same
and ive never seen forever
but i know well remain

and i will follow where this takes me
and my tomorrows long to be unknown
when all is shaken be my safety
in a world uncertain say youll be my stone

be my stone
in a world uncertain say youll be my stone

oh steady me
be my source of gravity
while me worlds unraveling
say youll never change
oh oh

and i will follow where this takes me
and my tomorrows long to be unknown
when all is shaken be my safety
in a world uncertain say youll be my stone

be my stone
in a world uncertain say youll be my stone

really wants to do
see i need you
and sometimes we need to
shed our facade and be just who we are
all broken and torn then we could be stars

oh we could be stars
we could be stars
we could be stars

piercing lights in the dark
make the galaxy ours
kingdom right where we are
shining bright as a morning
youll never be lonely
just promise youll love me
im never too far
and well never part
and we could be stars

oh we could be stars
we could be stars
oh we could be stars

just find way to get home
theres a space in my heart
open arms for you to run to
baby close your eyes and take the leap
to make believe in fairytales
ill meet you there
oh yeah ill fall too
see ive wanted you here
all along but my fear
just keeps haunting me wont let me go
so its hard to say i love you

we could be stars
oh we could be stars
we could be stars
we could be stars


she just wants to be beautiful
she goes unnoticed she knows no limits
she craves attention she praises an image
she prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
oh she dont see the light thats shining
deeper than the eyes can find it
maybe we have made her blind
so she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
cause covergirls dont cry after their face is made

but theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
you should know youre beautiful just the way you are
and you dont have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful
and you dont have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful

she has dreams to be an envy so shes starving
you know covergirls eat nothing
she says beauty is pain and theres beauty in everything
whats a little bit of hunger
i could go a little while longer she fades away
she dont see her perfect she dont understand shes worth it
or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
so to all the girls thats hurting
let me be your mirror help you see a little bit clearer
the light that shines within

theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
you should know youre beautiful just the way you are
and you dont have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful

no better you than the you that you are
no better you than the you that you are
no better life than the life were living
no better life than the life were living
no better time for your shine youre a star
no better time for your shine youre a star
oh youre beautiful oh youre beautiful

and theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
you should know youre beautiful just the way you are
and you dont have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful
and you dont have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful were stars and were beautiful



im sorry if i seem uninterested
oh im not listenin oh im indifferent
truly i aint got no business here
but since my friends are here i just came to kick it
but really i would rather be at home all by myself
not in this room with people who dont even care about my well being
i dont dance dont ask i dont need a boyfriend
so you can go back please enjoy your party
ill be here somewhere in the corner
under clouds of marijuana with this boy whos hollerin
and i can hardly hear
over this music i dont listen to
and i dont wanna get with you
so tell my friends that ill be over here

oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself what am i doin here
oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
and i cant wait til we can break up out of here

excuse me if i seem a little unimpressed with this
an antisocial pessimist but usually i dont mess with this
and i know you mean only the best and your
intentions arent to bother me but honestly id rather be
somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen to
and well discuss our big dreams how we plan to take over the planet
not there in the kitchen
with the girl whos always gossipin about her friends
oh tell them ill be here
cause he cant take whats in his cup no more
oh god why am i here

oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself what am i doin here
oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
and i cant wait til we can break up out of here

hours later congregatin next to the refrigerator
some girls talkin bout a hater she aint got none
how did it ever come to this i shouldve never come to this
so holla at me ill be in the car when youre done
im standoffish dont want what youre offerin
and im done talkin awfully sad it had to be that way
so tell my people when theyre ready that im ready
and im standin by the tv with my beanie low
yo ill be over here

oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself what am i doin here
oh oh oh here oh oh oh here


still got the flowers that you sent
and the note you wrote that said were meant to be forever
i keep them all as evidence
in a drawer under the mirror filled with empty promises
i dont know why
i keep letting you lie to me
hard as i try
it seems i cant break away
i thought that you would be the hero
come and save the day
but youre a villain
your sins unforgiven

im going down and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears lost beneath the stream
under the waves ive found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go head and wish me well
ill cry a wishing well
ill fly before i fail
ill set sail and drift away
so i wont need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears

i catch your scent in every wind
and i recall the love we had
i cant pretend that i dont miss you
every now and then
but the hurt is for the better
moving on its now or never
lost in the tide i cant keep my pillows dry
like theres a sea in my eyes
i realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
then it builds you coffins
and far too often
we end up falling to our demise

im going down and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears lost beneath the stream
under the waves ive found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go head and wish me well
ill cry a wishing well
ill fly before i fail
ill set sail and drift away
so i wont need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears

cry me a river build myself a bridge
im over this cant let memories become the death of me
im glad to see everything that you are
and i believe that you are everything i needed
but i dont need no more

im going down and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears lost beneath the stream
under the waves ive found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go head and wish me well
ill cry a wishing well
ill fly before i fail
ill set sail and drift away
so i wont need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears


tune in to find my peace and solitude
these empty rooms spin and i embrace the flaws of being human
the black and white and sometimes the greys that stay for days
the in between time
the meantime that make this song of life sing
play rest repeat read exactly what is written on the sheet
dont deviate  they say
but i will play whats best for me
ill press the keys and pull the strings
create a symphony thats mine

and ill spend my life penning my song my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls dont make history
so i may never be what you assume
dont want your hooks or autotune
if im offkey then thats alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when im gone
my song will carry on

let go
i let my voice be heard then listen for the echo
my own reverb is playing
cause im a movement
theres dissonance sometimes i make mistakes
so im human after all im not your expectations
but play rest repeat thats what they ask of me
just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
but ill play whats best for me
ill ring the bells and crash the cymbals
my harmonious desire

and ill spend my life penning my song my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls dont make history
so i may never be what you assume
dont want your hooks or autotune
if im offkey then thats alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when im gone
my song will carry on

in my time here i wanna be revered and remembered
oh let them say i came i conquered
so i wont fear and i cant blend in
you cant replace me and you cannot erase me
cause my song will live on beyond time

and ill spend my life penning my song my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls dont make history
so i may never be what you assume
dont want your hooks or autotune
if im offkey then thats alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when im gone
my song will carry on
and ill spend my life penning my song my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls dont make history
so i may never be what you assume
dont want your hooks or autotune
if im offkey then thats alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when im gone
my song will carry on

and blame god for looking too old
can you find all that you stand for
has been replaced with mountains of gold

you cannot dream yourself to notice
to feel pain and swallow fear
but can you stay up for the weekend
for next year

god i cant do this any more
though ill be laid down on the floor
as many feet walk through the door

im not alone

if i see a light flashing
could this mean that im coming home
if i see a man waving
does this mean that im not alone

if i see a light flashing

and i could let you slip away without a second glance

and im not proud of my address

we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us knows

i remember when your head caught flame
it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
well you laughed baby its okay
its buzzcut season anyway

explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

we ride the bus with the knees pulled in
people should see how were living
shut my eyes to the song that plays
sometimes this has a hot sweet taste

the men up on the news
they try to tell us all that we will lose
but its so easy in this blue
where everything is good

and ill never go home again
place the call feel it start
favourite friend
and nothings wrong when nothings true
i live in a hologram with you

where all the things that we do for fun
and ill breathe and it goes
play along
make believe its hyperreal
but i live in a hologram with you

cola with the burnt out taste
im the one you tell your fears to
therell never be enough of us

explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

and ill never go home again

where all the things that we do for fun
and ill breathe and it goes

theyre in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth

now bring my boys in
their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother
while he glows through the room

dancin around the lies we tell
dancin around big eyes as well ah
even the comatose
they dont dance and tell

we live in cities youll never see on screen
not very pretty but we sure know how to run things
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know were on each others team

im kind of over getting told
to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasnt my fault

and everyones competing
for a love they wont receive
cause what this palace wants is release

we live in cities youll never see on screen
not very pretty but we sure know how to run things
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know were on each others team

im kind of over getting told
to throw my hands up in the air
so there

im kinda older than i was
when i revelled without a care
so there

we live in cities youll never see on screen
not very pretty but we sure know how to run things
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know were on each others team

were on each others team
and you know were on each others team
were on each others team
and you know and you know and you know


theres a humming in the restless summer air
and were slipping off the course that we prepared
but in all chaos there is calculation
dropping glasses just to hear them break

its clear that someones gotta go
we mean it but i promise were not mean

they lose their minds for us
and now were in the ring
and were coming for blood

oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but were the gladiators
oh oh everyone a rager
oh oh but secretly theyre saviours

glory and gore go hand in hand
thats why were making headlines
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but victorys contagious

chance is the only game i play with baby
we let our battles choose us

they lose their minds for us
and now were in the ring
and were coming for blood

oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but were the gladiators
oh oh everyone a rager
oh oh but secretly theyre saviours

glory and gore go hand in hand
thats why were making headlines
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but victorys contagious

noone round heres good
at keeping their eyes closed
the suns starting to light up
when were walking home

tired little laughs goldlie promises
well always win at this
i dont ever think about death
its alright if you do its fine

we gladiate but i guess
were really fighting ourselves
roughing up our minds so were ready
when the kill time comes

wide awake in bed
words in my brain
secretly you love this
do you even wanna go free

let me in the ring
ill show you what that big word means

oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but were the gladiators
oh oh everyone a rager
oh oh but secretly theyre saviours

glory and gore go hand in hand
thats why were making headlines
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but victorys contagious


today is my birthday and im riding high
hair is dripping hiding that im terrified
but this is summer playing dumber than in fall
everything i say falls right back into everything

im not in the swing of things
but what i really mean is
not in the swing of things yet

riding around on the bikes were still sane
i wont be her tripping over onstage
hey its all cool

i still like hotels but i think thatll change
still like hotels and my newfound fame
hey promise i can stay good

im little but im coming for the crown
im little but im coming for you
im little but im coming for the title
held by everyone whos up

all work and no play
never made me lose it
all business all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play

all work and no play
let me count the bruises
all business all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play

only bad people live to see
their likeness set in stone
only bad people live to see
their likeness set in stone
what does that make me

im not in the swing of things
but what i really mean is
not in the swing of things yet

now im not in the swing of things
but what i really mean is
not in the swing of things yet

all work and no play
never made me lose it
all business all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play


we wouldnt be seen dead here in the day
i guess youre lucky that its dark now
and if i like it then well stay
impress the empress take a shot now

we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are

up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop
to stop this

give the bruises out like gifts
youll get the picture of your dreams
i wont be smiling but the notes from my admirers
fill the dashboard just the same ah a ah

we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are

up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop
to stop this when were

up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop
to stop this

ill let you in on something big
i am not a white teeth teen
i tried to join but never did
the way they are the way they seem
is something else its in the blood
their molars blinking like the lights
in the underpass where we all sit
and do nothing and love it


we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are out


that slow burn wait while it gets dark
bruising the sun
i feel grown up with you in your car
i know its dumb

weve both got a million bad habits to kick
not sleeping is one
were biting our nails youre biting my lip
im biting my tongue

when people are talking people are talking
when people are talking people are talking

raise a glass cause im not done saying it
they all wanna get rough get away with it
let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone
were all alone were alone

all my fake friends and all of their noise
complain about work
theyre studying business i study the floor
maybe the internet raised us
or maybe people are jerks

when people are talking people are talking

raise a glass cause im not done saying it
they all wanna get rough get away with it
let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone
were all alone were alone

all the doubleedged people and schemes
they make a mess then go home and get clean
youre my best friend and were dancing in a world alone

i know were not everlasting
were a trainwreck waiting to happen
one day the blood wont flow so gladly
one day well all get still
get still

when people are talking people are talking
when people are talking people are talking

raise a glass cause im not done saying it
they all wanna get rough get away with it
let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone
were all alone were alone

all the doubleedged people and schemes
they make a mess then go home and get clean
youre my best friend so were dancing in a world alone
were all alone were alone

when people are talking people are talking
when people are talking people are talking
when people are talking people are talking
when people are talking people are talking
let em talk


we roll in every summer when theres strength in our numbers
and your breaths hot and gross but i kiss you like a lover
like stick to the seats of the cars of mongerito
i forget the mallets from the lessons that i went to

and jamie picks fights but the weekends short lived
because no one can be bothered when its humid like this
and we roll in every summer like its shameful to be underneath
the ceiling or a roof truck come out and steal our thunder

now the days are getting colder and the burning of our limbs
doesnt happen quite as bad and the burnings dry skin
deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits
to like the movies that we watch to pretend it wasnt winter

and everywhere we go i can feel the subtle taste
of the dtalk groan and the locker room where we stayed
and youre no better at swimming than you were in the beginning

go all the way have your fun have it all
this will take you down
get through the days do your thing do it well
this will take you down

go all the way have your fun have it all
this will take you down
get through the days do your thing do it well
this will take you down

ill pull the trick if i want to
ill pull the trick and it comes true
im chewing gum and its killing me
were getting dead and its the right way to do it

i see you happy in the front seat
i see you with all of your front teeth
youre allergic but you never said
were getting dead and its the right way

go all the way have your fun have it all
this will take you down
get through the days do your thing do it well
this will take you down

go all the way have your fun have it all
this will take you down
get through the days do your thing do it well
this will take you down


all my life ive been fighting a war
i cant talk to you or your friends
its not only you my heart jumps around
when im alluded to this will not do

cause i was raised up to be admired
to be noticed but when youre withdrawn
its the closest thing to assault
when all eyes are on you this will not do

im faking glory lick my lips toss my hair
and turn the smile on and the storys brand new
but i can take it from here
ill find my own bravado

its a switch flipped its a pill tipped back
its a moon eclipsed woah
and i can tell you that when the lights come on
ill be ready for this

its in your bloodstream a collision of atoms
that happens before your eyes
its a marathon run or a mountain you scale
without thinking of size

i was frightened of every little thing
that i thought was out to get me down
to trip me up and laugh at me
but i learned not to want the quiet of a room
with no one around to find me out
i want the applause the approval
the things that make me go

its a switch flipped its a pill tipped back
its a moon eclipsed woah
and i can tell you that when the lights come on
ill be ready for this

its in your bloodstream a collision of atoms
that happens before your eyes
its a marathon run or a mountain you scale
without thinking of size

i was frightened of every little thing
that i thought was out to get me down
to trip me up and laugh at me
but i learned not to want the quiet of a room
with no one around to find me out
i want the applause the approval
the things that make me go


theres nothing i want but money and time
million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick
theres nothing more cruel than only nine lives
a limit in spite will do the trick trick trick trick

we can leave the house lead the party let the people know
go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go

theres nothing as fun as coming untied
and running with the kids in the park park park park
theres nothing thats hurt like letting you go
tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark

we can leave the house leave the party let the people know
go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go
its not about just being out with the right people
cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw

and now im letting you know
and now im letting you know
and now im letting you know
and now im letting you know


im in a clique but i want out
its not the same as when i was punched
in the old days there was enough
the card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood

i was in but i want out
my mothers love is choking me
im sick of words that hang above my head
what about the kid its time the kid got free

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
youll get punched for the love club
for the love club

i joined the club and its all on
there are fights for being my best friend
and the girls get their claws out
theres something about hanging out with the wicked kids

take the pill make it too ill
the other day i forgot my old address
im sitting pretty on the throne
theres nothing more i want
except to be alone

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
youll get punched for the love club
for the love club

your clothes are soaked and you dont know where to go
so drop your chin and take yourself back home
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again

the only problem that i got with the club
is how youve severed from the people who watched you grow up
when youre a member go on your great adventure again
they will be waiting at the end

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
youll get punched for the love club
for the love club

break the newsyoure walking out
to be a good man for someone else

hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
did my best to exist just for you

ill love you till you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours i stumbled on a secret power
ill find a way to be without you babe

i still feel you now and then
slow like pseudoephedrine
when you see me will you say ive changed
i ride the subway read the signs
i let the seasons change my mind
i love it here since ive stopped needing you


in my head i play a supercut of us
all the magic we gave off
all the love we had and lost
and in my head
the visions never stop
these ribbons wrap me up
but when i reach for you
theres just a supercut

in your car the radio up
in your car the radio up
we keep trying to talk about us
im someone you maybe might love
ill be your quiet afternoon crush
make you crazy over my touch

but its just a supercut of us

so i fall
into continents and cars
all the stages and the stars
i turn all of it
to just a supercut

because ours are the moments i play in the dark
we were wild and fluorescent come home to my heart uh

even though i knew it was

i didnt wanna call you back
cause i knew that i was wrong

one in the same
never to change
our love was beautiful
we got it all
destined to fall
our love was tragical
wanted to call
no need to fight
you know i wouldnt lie
well leave it on the line

listen baby

never wouldve said forever
if we knew it ends so fast
why did you say i love you
if you knew that it wouldnt last

the line is breaking up
or is that just us
or is that just us

one in the same
never to change
our love was beautiful

destined to fall
our love was tragical
wanted to call
no need to fight
you know i wouldnt lie

destined to fall
our love was tragical
wanted to call
no need to fight
you know i wouldnt lie

did you forget
that i was even alive
did you forget
everything we ever had
did you forget
did you forget
about me

ever standing by my side
what we were feeling inside
now im left to forget
about us

but somewhere we went wrong
we were once so strong
our love is like a song
you cant forget it

so now i guess
this is where we have to stand
did you regret
ever holding my hand
never again
please dont forget
dont forget

we had it all
we were just about to fall
even more in love
than we were before
i wont forget
i wont forget
about us

but somewhere we went wrong
we were once so strong
our love is like a song
you cant forget it

somewhere we went wrong
we were once so strong
our love is like a song
you cant forget it
at all

and at last
all the pictures have been burned
and all the past
is just a lesson that weve learned
i wont forget
please dont forget us

somewhere we went wrong
our love is like a song
but you wont sing along
youve forgotten
about us

dont forget

she was given the world
so much that she couldnt see
and she needed someone
to show her who she could be

and she tried to survive
wearing her heart on her sleeve
but i needed you to believe

you had your dreams i had mine
you had your fears i was fine
showed me what i couldnt find
when two different worlds collide
la da da da da

she was scared of it all
watching from far away
she was given a role
never knew just when to play
and she tried to survive
living her life on her own
always afraid of the thrown
but youve given me strength to find hope

you had your dreams i had mine
you had your fears i was fine
showed me what i couldnt find
when two different worlds collide

she was scared unprepared
left in the dark falling apart

showed me what i couldnt find
when two different worlds collide

until you give the truth a little twist
as if youre gonna get away with this

down at the bottom of your soul
didnt think you could go so low

too bad you couldnt even stay on key
if your life is such a mystery
why dont you just stick to acting

you thought that you could get to my best friend
without a script your game is lacking

didnt think you could go so low
look at what youve done

summer came it took me by surprise
a california sunshine in my eyes
driving with the top down
we sing along to our favorite songs
nothing could go wrong

laughing as we gazed under the moon
you kissed me and it never felt too soon
hard to believe that anything
could tear us apart
then you break my heart

now i know who you are
you got nothin on me
i see i should have known it from the start
you cant tell me lies dont even try
cause this is goodbye
goodbye

caught you from the corner of my eye
you smiled at a girl while passing by
thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
i know whats going on
it didnt take me long

wasnt hard to read between the lines
the necklace in your car that wasnt mine
nothing i would give do or say
now im on my way
now its too late

now i know who you are
you got nothin on me
i see i should of known it from the start
you cant tell me lies dont even try
cause this is goodbye

to broken promises
time to face your carelessness
dont fool me with apologies
and by crawling on your knees

you got nothin on me
you got nothin on me

i know who you are
now i see i should have known it from the start

you cant tell me lies dont even try
cause this is goodbye

now i know who you are
you got nothin on me
i see i should have known it from the start
you cant tell me lies dont even try
cause this is goodbye
goodbye


im standing in the center of the room
i watch the boys follow girls perfume
all is as it should be i assume
except for the distance between me and you

youre standing as a flower on the wall
the room is still but were about to fall
and all the names that brought us here
simply fade away

who you are is falling over me
who you are is everything i need

im hoping
im waiting
im praying you are the one
im hoping
im waiting
im praying you are the one

i used the line you were supposed to say
and all the names that brought us here
now we have to thank

who you are is falling over me
who you are has got me on my knees

im hoping
im waiting
im praying you are the one

if you are i will wait i will follow

as long as were promised tomorrow

who you are is falling over me
who you are has got me on my knees

im hoping
im waiting
im praying you are the one
im hoping
im waiting
im praying you are the one

you are the one


i hear what youre not saying
its driving me crazy
its like we stopped breathing in this room
were both the last to be leaving
i know what youre thinking
i wish youd make you move

its much too quiet in here
i wanna disappear
im hearing myself thinking too clear
its too quiet in here
make it all go away
why cant we break this silence
finally

its like you know where im going
you follow me home but
i never invite you inside
i see what youre not showing
ive got you alone but
the air is so still its weird

its much too quiet in here
i wanna disappear
im hearing myself thinking too clear
its too quiet in here
make it all go away
why cant we break this silence
finally

dont stop dont stop
just promise youll kiss me goodbye
whats taking so long
dont tell me youre not gonna try
the tensions building in my mind
i wanna scream and i know why

its much too quiet in here
i wanna disappear
im hearing myself thinking too clear
its too quiet in here
make it all go away
why cant we break this silence
finally

make it all go away
its so quiet in here


before i fall
too fast
kiss me quick
but make it last
so i can see
how badly this will hurt me
when you say goodbye
keep it sweet
keep it slow
let the future pass
and dont let go
i could fall too soon
to this beautiful moonlight

but youre so hypnotizing
youve got me laughing while i sing
youve got me smiling in my sleep
and i can see this unraveling
your love is where im falling
but please dont catch me

see this heart
wont settle down
like a child running
scared from a clown
im terrified
of what youd do
my stomach screams
just when i look at you
run far away
so i can breathe
even though youre
far from suffocating me
i cant set my hopes too high
cause every hello ends with a
goodbye

but youre so hypnotizing
youve got me laughing while i sing
youve got me smiling in my sleep
and i can see this unraveling
your love is where im falling
but please dont catch me

so now you see
why im scared
i cant open up my heart
without a care
but here i go
its what i feel
and for the first time in my
life i know its real

but youre so hypnotizing
youve got me laughing while i sing
youve got me smiling in my sleep
and i can see this unraveling
your love is where im falling
so please dont catch me
if this is love please dont break me
im giving up so
just catch me


now you told me on a sunday that it wasnt gonna work
i tried to cry myself to sleep cause it was supposed to hurt
we sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out
i knew what you were thinking before youd say it aloud

dont say youre sorry cause im not even breaking
youre not worth the time that this is taking

i knew better than to let you break my heart
the soul youll never see again wont be showing scars
you still love her i can see it in your eyes
the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie

every time you lie every time you lie

i woke up the next morning with a smile on my face
and a long list of gentlemen happy to take your place
less trashier much classier than who you proved to be
how longs it gonna take before you see that shes no me

i knew better than to let you break my heart
the soul youll never see again wont be showing scars oh no no
you still love her i can see it in your eyes
the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie

thats the price you pay for your mistakes goodbye to dreaming
so dont say youre sorry cause im not gonna listen

i knew better than to let you break my heart
the soul youll never see again wont be showing scars oh no no
you still love her i can see it in your eyes
the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie

oh every time you lie
dont say youre sorry every time you lie
dont say youre sorry oh

the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie


i cant take your hand and lead you to the water
i cant make you feel what you dont feel but you know you wanna
find out how to crack me log in try to hack me

underneath the surface
theres so much you need to know
and you might feel like youre drowning
but thats what i need to let go

kick senseless my defenses

we cant stop the world but theres so much more that we can do
you cant stop this girl from falling more in love with you
you said nobody has to know give us time to grow and take it slow
but id stop the world if they finally let us be alone let us be alone

im hearing the noise hearing the noise from all around
and im on the edge im on the edge of breakin down
like bonnie and clyde lets find a ride and ditch this town
to keep it alive keep it alive dont make a sound

we cant stop the world but theres so much more that we can do
you cant stop this girl from falling more in love with you
you said nobody has to know give us time to grow and take it slow

but ive got something left to say

dont let these memories get left behind

dont surrender surrender surrender
please remember remember december

to what they say dont go that way

ive been bruised and ive been broken
cant believe that i put up with all this pain
ive been used and i was choking
on the promise i would never fall again mm

i used to sing to your twisted symphony
the weights that had me trapped inside your misery
but now i know the reason why i couldnt breathe

cause all i want is everything youre not
so go ahead and slam the door cause you cant shut me out
and no i dont dont care what you say
cause all i really all i really want is everything youre not

never gonna break my heart again
never gonna see your face again
never wanna feel this way again

your darkness was my weakness
but it turns out that it only went so deep deep
a meaningless diversion
that is all that you ever meant to me me me me

and i am done with your twisted symphony
the words that had me sound like stolen poetry
i tore the pages and i can finally breathe

cause all i want i everything youre not
so go ahead and slam the door cause you cant shut me out
and no i dont dont care what you say
cause all i really all i really want is everything youre not

never gonna break my heart again
never gonna see your face again

sometimes you think youll be find by yourself
cause a dream is a wish you make all alone
its easy to feel like you dont need help
but its harder to walk on your own

youll change inside
when you realize
the world comes to life
and everythings all right
from beginning to end
when you have a friend
by your side
that helps you to find
the beauty of all
when youll open your heart and
believe in
the gift of a friend
the gift of a friend

someone who knows when your lost and your scared
there through the highs and the lows
someone you can count on someone who cares
besides you where ever you go

youll change inside
when you realize
the world comes to life
and everythings all right
from beginning to end
when you have a friend
by your side
that helps you to find
the beauty of all
when youll open your heart and
believe in
the gift of a friend

and when the hope crashes down
shattering to the ground
you youll feel all alone
when you dont know which way to go
and theres no such leading you on
youre not alone

the world comes to life
and everythings all right
from beginning to end
when you have a friend
by your side
that helps you to find
the beauty of all
when youll open your heart and
believe in
when you believe in
you can believe in the gift from a friend

and we try and try and try and try

that we meet in the middle
on our way back down to earth

so far away and now i just need you here

and we cry and cry and cry and cry
and we try and try and try and try

im an opportunity and i knock so softly
sometimes i get loud when i wish everybodyd just
get off me
so many players youd think i was a ball game
its every man for themselves there are no
team mates
this life gets lonely when everybody wants
something
theyll smile up in your face
but theyll get theirs eventually
and i hope im there

surrounded by familiar faces without names
none of them know me or want to share my pain
and they only wish to bask in my light then fade
away
to win my love to them a game
to watch me live my life in vain
when all is done and the glitter fades fades
away
theyll get theirs eventually
and i hope im there

i drank your poison cause you told me its wine
shame on you if you fooled me once

i guess im trying to find
a borrowed dream or a superstar
i want to be a star
is life good to you or is it bad
i cant tell anymore
do you even know what you have

lying awake
watching the sunlight
how the birds will sing
as i count the rings around my eyes
constantly pushing
the world i know aside
i dont even feel the pain
i dont even want to try

im looking for a way to become
the person that i dreamt up
when i was 
oh nothing is ever enough
ooh baby it aint enough
for what it may seem

do you even know who you are
im still trying to find
a borrowed dream or a superstar
everybody wants to be
is life good to you or is it bad
i cant tell anymore
do you even know what you have
no

cause im wondering
how you really feel
im a lonely girl
ill tell a tale for you
cause im just trying to make
all my dreams come true

oh yeah yeah
a borrowed dream or a superstar
oh i wanted to be a star
is life good to you or is it bad
i cant tell i cant tell anymore
do you even know what you have

do you even know who you are
oh im trying to find
a rising dream or a falling star
oh i have all these dreams
is life good to you or is it bad
i cant tell anymore

a rising dream or a falling star

i got used to your pain but you know its cause

we can go until the morning glow
we can go higher and higher and higher

before i was found i felt like i could drain the ocean
before i was found i didnt want to breathe out
now my soul beats a sound loud enough to quiet the thunder
a love with no doubt and now im never gonna slow down

take our bodies higher and higher and higher
we can go until the morning glow

sat back with the window down
eighty an hour and the radio loud
the same songs with the same old rhymes

and i promised id be there but you dont make it easy

loving you loving you leaves me hurt
all i do all i do is get burned
loving you loving you

count stacks of the routine lies
funny how easy you could see my blindside
still the same songs with the same old beats

and i cant help but drive away from all the mess you made
you sent this hurricane now it wont go away
and i promised id be there but you dont make it easy

set on fire in a silver dream

to swing me all of your line

im a little bit lost without you
without you

and im digging down holes without you
cant be on my own without you
im a little bit lost without you

hold me close when its over
life goes slow loving sober
feel my bones getting older
sadness grows when youre cold

cause i am one step heavy and two steps high
hold it steady with you by my side
one step heavy and two steps high
two steps high

cause im kicking up stones without you
cant pick up the phone without you
im a little bit lost without you
without you

and im digging down holes without you
cant be on my own without you
im a little bit lost without you
without you

without you
without you
im a little bit lost without you
without you

and im digging down holes without you
cant be on my own without you
im a little bit lost without you
without you

throwing fire trying to make it right
youre getting higher than the ceiling lights
and falling hard enough to lose the fight

not in it for the money just in it for the thrill

living in the moment paying for the kill
golden grill of sadness midlife wasted youth
always ends up like this always gonna lose

dazzle me dazzle me dazzle me with gold

dazzle me dazzle me throw away your gold
youll never be what you wanna be with all that money that money that money

not in it for the money just in it for the thrill
living in the moment paying for the kill
golden grill of sadness midlife wasted youth

theyre building towers that are high enough to see the clouds
yet it dont bother me
the elevators working overtime up and down
yet it dont bother me

cause i need something more than everything
a higher self deep within
cause i need something more than everything
a higher self a higher self

and i know we need a little heart hope
i know weve gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope

theyre building aeroplanes faster than the speed of light
yet it dont bother me
the endless cities multiplying out oceansize
yet it dont bother me

cause i need something more than everything
a higher self deep within
cause i need something more than everything
a higher self a higher self

and i know we need a little heart hope
i know weve gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
cause there is something more than everything

a room filled up with faces and the air so thick i taste it
locking lips like they all wasted tangled hips like its a spaceship
heavy heads are racing down the hallways to the basement
where the darkness fills the space and they can feel themselves erasing
can you feel yourself erasing
theyre bursting at the corners as the ceilings getting shorter
and im stuck between a talker and a vhs recorder
the heat seeps through the border as our ice melts down to water
can you feel it getting smaller

i need to be solo
freedom in the mono
find a space and let go
i need to be solo solo
now im breathing in and im breathing out
breathing in and im breathing out
im breathing in and im breathing out
breathing in and im breathing out

their mouths are dripping dryer as their souls are slipping higher
its like treading on a wire laced with kerosene and fire
limbs entangled in kaleidoscopes of prima donna choirs
ah ah ah oh oh oh oh

i need to be solo
freedom in the mono
find a space and let go
i need to be solo solo
now im breathing in and im breathing out
breathing in and im breathing out
im breathing in and im breathing out
breathing in and im breathing out

i need to be solo
breathing in and im breathing out
freedom in the lie low
breathing in and im breathing out
find a space and let go
breathing in and im breathing out
i need to be solo solo
breathing in and im breathing out
i need to be solo
breathing in and im breathing out
freedom in the lie low
breathing in and im breathing out
find a space and let go
breathing in and im breathing out
i need to be solo solo
breathing in and im breathing out


lovesick the beat inside my head
waves struck a sea of bitterness
lights out solo in the blue
before i found you

days passed slowly lost and low
you gave me hope and now theres only

blood running in my veins
ive never been here before
and i got love falling like the rain
i never couldve asked for more
i got so much soul inside my bones
take a look at me now
im young forever in the sun
im living ultralife

turn down the voice inside my head
cause heaven only knows why we feel this emptiness
but i will climb out find another view
now ive found you

days passed slowly lost and low
you gave me hope and now theres only

blood running in my veins
ive never been here before
and i got love falling like the rain
i never couldve asked for more
i got so much soul inside my bones
take a look at me now
im young forever in the sun
ever since you came im living ultralife
ultralife with me ultralife with me
ultralife with me ultralife with me

found me on a basement floor
back when i had lost it all
told me what the fight was for
and im not giving up no more
you elevate the life in me
illuminate the inbetween
forever gonna feel this free
and im not giving up now

lovesick the beat inside my head
waves struck a sea of bitterness
lights out solo in the blue
but now ive found you

blood running in my veins
ive never been here before
and i got love falling like the rain
i never couldve asked for more
i got so much soul inside my bones
take a look at me now
im young forever in the sun
ever since you came im living ultralife
im living ultralife
oh were living ultralife
were living ultralife
im living ultralife


im getting high getting high
getting high on humans
sitting in the backseat dead heat summer
staring at the ground in a lucid light
i can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
running round my head in a holy fire
open up the doors let me feel that zephyr
freshen up the air underneath the streets
now im locking eyes with a silent stranger
dont run dont hide

and i can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
were making waves of conversation
got a rush of energy

cause im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans
im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans

elevate the headstrong dead long halo
caught up in our skin gotta fight the grind
i can make your day glow sun to rainbow
colour in your step let me lose your mind
animate the air with a stone cold question
do you have the time do you hate your life
now im locking eyes with a silent stranger
dont run dont hide

and i can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
were making waves of conversation
got a rush of energy

cause im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans
im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans
every time i meet your eyes i can feel life come alive
and im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans

we ride up we slide up
we wont stop we wont stop
we ride up we slide up
we wont stop no we wont stop
we ride up we slide up
we wont stop lighting our minds up
we ride up we slide up
we wont stop lighting our minds up

cause im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans
im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans
every time i meet your eyes i can feel life come alive
and im getting high getting high
im getting high on humans

cause im getting getting high on humans


you walk around the town like you born in a golden crown
youre speaking with the angels loud but no one understands ya
you got the sharpest bite as any killer sharker might
and you control the water like the desert doesnt matter

youre so full of it
and were so sick of it
youre so full of it
and were so sick of it

cause its all about you
its all about you
its all about you
its all about you

you say its not enough youre sipping from a silver cup
but is that how she brought you up to blame the hand that feeds ya
you only seek to undermine you only seek to never die

youre so full of it
and were so sick of it
youre so full of it
and were so sick of it

cause its all about you
its all about you
its all about you
its all about you

and every time you get stars in your eyes
and the planets align in the centre
pushing on out til the walls are all wide
and youre out of your mind in the centre
we see your cover we see another
fooling yourself in the mirror
where is your heart where is the truth

when its all about you
its not about you
its not about you
its not about you

youre so full of it
and were so sick of it
you so full of it
and we so sick of it all

cause its all about you
its all about you
its all about you
its not about you


i could be the only i could be the only one

you got that throne
baby you got that throne
that golden majestic glow
delight delight delight delight
and i got that hope
ready electric go go
super volcano flow
delight delight delight delight

and i could hold you endlessly
ultralife just you and me
oh my heart is aching
feel my body breaking
theres magic in the way you move
stop the world its only you
oh my heart is waking
cause i could be your one and only


i could be the only i could be the only one

you got that way
baby you got the way with
flying me outer space
delight delight delight delight
and i got that taste
that animalistic chase
delight delight delight delight

and i could hold you endlessly
ultralife just you and me
oh my heart is aching
feel my body breaking
theres magic in the way you move
stop the world its only you
oh my heart is waking
cause i could be your one and only


i could be the only i could be the only one

i could be the only i could be the only one
i could be the only i could be the only one
i could be the only i could be the only one
i could be the only i could be the only one


heading west to where the sun sleeps
city fallout let our lungs breathe
can you hold me i cant even speak
oh my here it goes

and so the echoes slip in slowly
the edges of you keep me holy
can i hold you i cant even speak
oh my here it goes

we found love on an empty page
kill the stars above trying to fight the fade
and now my heart skips heavy underneath the waves
we are done we are gone

cause this is already bigger
this is already bigger than love
this is already bigger
this is already bigger than us
its bigger than you
its bigger than me
its bigger than you
its bigger than me
its bigger than love

hands are shaking at the last call
in the silence can you hear me scream
oh my here it goes

we found love on an empty page
kill the stars above trying to fight the fade
and now my heart skips heavy underneath the waves
we are done we are gone

cause this is already bigger
this is already bigger than love
this is already bigger
this is already bigger than us
its bigger than you
its bigger than me
its bigger than you
its bigger than me
its bigger than love

so ill hold steady like a tiger in the dark
all my days are ready to be hopeless at the stars
cause this is already bigger than love
oh its bigger than us

yeah this is already bigger
this is already bigger than love
this is already bigger
this is already bigger than us
its bigger than you
its bigger than me
its bigger than you
its bigger than me
its bigger than love


like two satellites in separate orbit
like a quiet life thats slowly distorted
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough
like two chemicals erupting in thunder
up high in vertigo you left me to wonder
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough

cause you were the best thing for me
stole my mind and found my dreams
baby if only you could see heart strings heart strings
heart strings heart strings
best thing for me
open the doors and set me free
baby if only you could see heart strings heart strings
heart strings heart strings

like two radios our frequency fading
why cant we start again without tessellating
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough
like the afterglow your words were a million
cut short now heaven knows a love without feeling
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough

cause you were the best thing for me
stole my mind and found my dreams
baby if only you could see heart strings heart strings
heart strings heart strings
best thing for me
open the doors and set me free
baby if only you could see heart strings heart strings
heart strings heart strings

stop pulling my heart strings my heart strings
you got a grip on my heart strings and i dont wanna take it no more
stop pulling my heart strings my heart strings
you got a grip on my heart strings and i dont wanna take it no more

cause you were the best thing for me
stole my mind and found my dreams
baby if only you could see heart strings heart strings
heart strings heart strings
best thing for me
open the doors and set me free
baby if only you could see heart strings heart strings
heart strings heart strings

baby if only you could see heart strings heart strings
heart strings heart strings


i sleep away all the light
i keep away out of sight out of sight
i slip away and lose my mind lose my mind
oh my my my
oh how i tried

and as we lie silently
your body soft so close to me close to me
i creep away and let you sleep
i dream today tomorrow speaks
oh my my my
oh how i tried

and as the sun comes out to play
so soon i wish the day away day away
still left unsaid the things to say
i lost my heart to window panes
oh my my my
oh how i tried
oh my my my
oh how i tried

oh my my my

hanging on a silver string
all the love that we couldve been
summer fading out the spring
feel the warmth underneath your wings
and i will never let you go
all the words you want to scream
take my heart slowly out of me
forever falling in a dream
all the love that we couldve been

i never get high when youre feeling low
im pulling down stars just to make you glow
its just the way you are when youre overgrown
im chasing down light in the indigo
its just the way you are when youre overgrown
and i will never let you go
and i will never let you go

promise i will never run
catching fire let the light become
shallow edges of the sun
feel the heat hold it in your lungs
never couldve loved you more
by your side in a quiet roar
this is what my hope is for
watch you float when the waters gone

i never get high when youre feeling low
im pulling down stars just to make you glow
its just the way you are when youre overgrown
im chasing down light in the indigo
its just the way you are when youre overgrown
and i will never let you go
no i will never let you go

did i did i did i do you wrong

theres a space in between
like a grey evergreen
where the hurt never meant
starts to linger
on the pavement below
see a crack that i know
all the corners of you
all the bones that i knew
i said i would never come back
screaming at the walls in jet black
hurt until my words are out flat
can i whisper it back

what a waste what a waste
what a waste to be so alone
a waste what a waste
what a waste to be so alone
a waste what a waste
what a waste to be so alone

theres a space in between
like a grey evergreen
where the hurt never mend

hurt until my words are out flat
can i whisper it back
i said i would never come back

reality of dreams younger for memories of a still wonder
of who i might be
and for her its hard to stomach whats left behind and whats to come in the same introduction of a king

i produce like eagles
soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
so i can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
while these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
to write stories a young poetic genius
and i mean this theres never been a day off
never been laid off my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off

but being and feeling alone was too much to face
though everyone said that she was so strong
what they didnt know is that she could barely carry on

so she didnt let it get in her way

sometimes it all gets a little too much
but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
and you dont have to be afraid because were all the same
and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

she would always tell herself she could do this
she would use no help it would be just fine
but when it got hard she would lose her focus
so take my hand and well be alright

and she knew that she would be okay
so she didnt let it get in her way

sometimes it all gets a little too much

say hello then say farewell to the places you know
we are all mortals arent we any moment this could go
cry cry cry even though that wont change a thing
but you should know you should hear that i have loved
i have loved the good times here and i will miss our good times here

you must believe in something something something
you gotta believe in something something something

oh so hot i could catch a tan on it
got me sweating so much we can swim on the dancefloor
we gonn have to mes around and put a dam on it
dam on it

dont take them off
put your hands on it
put your hands on it
put your hands on it
put your hands on it

put your hands on it
put your hands on it

put your hands on me

i cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
and then it was clear  i cant deny i really miss him
to think that i was wrong
i guess you dont know what you got till its gone
pain is just a consequence of love
im saying sorry for the sake of us

he wasnt my everything till we were nothing and its taken me a lot to say
and now that hes gone my heart is missing something so its time to push my pride away
cause you are you are you are my everything
you are you are you are my everything

i know youre not far but i still cant handle all the distance
youre travelling with my heart  i hope this is a temporary feeling
cause its too much to bear
without you and i know sorry aint the cure
if i cross your mind just know im yours
cause what we got is worth fighting for cause you are

you werent my everything till we were nothing and its taken me a lot to say
now that youre gone my heart is missing something so its time i push my pride away
you are you are you are my everything
you are you are you are my everything

you are you are you are
you are you are you are my everything


i know what shes like
shes out of her mind
and wraps herself around the truth
shell jump on that flight
make you tear up the room

she loves when everybodys watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
she loves nobody else but you


shell dance in the dark
a real work of art
her eyes could burn down the room
so get out while you can
you dont understand
she doesnt know how to lose

she loves when everybodys watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
she loves nobody else but you


shell run with your mind and pull you in tight
then trade you in for something new
i know what its like i fell for it twice
and now im just warning you

she loves when everybodys watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
that she loves nobody else but you

she loves when everybodys watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
she loves nobody else but you

shes on the loose
shes on the loose


waking up to kiss you and nobodys there
the smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
its hard
yesterday i thought i saw your shadow running round
its funny how things never change in this old town

so far from the stars
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now

if the whole world was watching id still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth

everything comes back to you

i saw that you moved on with someone new
in the pub that we met hes got his arms around you

its so hard
so hard

and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now

cause if the whole world was watching id still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you

you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when im next to you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you

and i know that its wrong
that i cant move on
but theres something about you
if the whole world was watching id still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth

everything comes back to you
you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when im next to you

over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you

when you feel your loves been taken
when you know theres something missing
in the dark were barely hangin on
then you rest your head upon my chest
and you feel like there aint nothing left
im afraid that what we had is gone

then i think of the start
and it echoes a spark
and i remember the magic electricity
then i look in my heart
theres a light in the dark
still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
that i wanna keep
please dont leave
please dont leave

when you lay there and youre sleeping
hear the patterns of your breathing
and i tell you things youve never heard before
asking questions to the ceiling
never knowing what youre thinking
im afraid that what we had is gone

then i think of the start
and it echoes a spark
and i remember the magic electricity
then i look in my heart
theres a light in the dark
still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
that i wanna keep
please dont leave
please dont leave

and i want this to pass
and i hope this wont last
last too long

then i think of the start
and it echoes a spark
and i remember the magic electricity
then i look in my heart
theres a light in the dark
still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
that i wanna keep
please dont leave

feeling so electrified
with the heat of a million suns
you know just one touch can keep me high
and i think ill never come down
till a couple days go by
and youre nowhere to be found

all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
its a crime
its a crime
how youre reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry

so i try to shake you out my head
try to dance with somebody new
but you got those lips so red
and that smoking voice you do
so i know its pointless anyway
cause there aint nobody else
that could light me up so bright
and break this crazy spell

all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
its a crime
its a crime
how youre reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry

if i wait a little longer
then maybe youll come back around
wait a little longer
then maybe youll be ready now
cause i would wait forever
for you to fall back into my arms
so come on

all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
its a crime
its a crime
how youre reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry
all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
its a crime
its a crime
how youre reeling me in with the games you play

the concept of school seems so secure
sophomore three yurrs aint picked a career
cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs
cause her babydaddy dont really care
shes so precious with the peer pressure
couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off now she look like eve
and she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
single black female addicted to retail and well

oh when it all it all falls down

thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollies and pashas done drove me crazy
i cant even pronounce nothing pass that versaysee
then i spent fourhundred bucks on this
and i cant even go to the grocery store
without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
it seems we living the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
we trying to buy back our forty acres
and for that paper look how low we a stoop


we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
wea buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need em
things we buy to cover up whats inside
cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
thats why shorties holler where the ballers at
drug dealer buy jordans crackhead buy crack
and a white man get paid off of all of that
but i aint even gonna act holier than thou
before i had a house and id do it again
cause i want to be on  and park pushin a benz

or here to convert atheists into believers
im just tryna say the way school need teachers
the way kathie lee needed regis thats the way i need jesus
so here go my single dog radio needs this
they say you can rap about anything except for jesus
that means guns sex lies videotape
but if i talk about god my record wont get played huh

and when your feet cold mines is sizzling
this is not an image this is god given

its the most consistent hov
give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
its hov tradition jeff gordon of rap
im back to claim pole position holla at ya boy


down for my grandfather who took my mama
made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
at the tender age of six she was arrested for the sitins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
but we can make it to jacobs and to the dealership
swear i hear new music and i just dont be feelin it
racisms still alive they just be concealin it
but i know they dont want me in the damn club
they even made me show id to get inside of sams club
i done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
swear ive been baptized least three or four times
its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
so i promised to mr rainey im gonna marry your daughter
and you know i gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you see the car i bought her
you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
but i cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
cause look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watching me from the other side

when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing i found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down

we are all here for a reason on a particular path
you dont need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math
cats think im delirious but im so damn serious
thats why i expose my soul to the globe the world
im trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
im not just another individual
my spirit is a part of this thats why i get spiritual
but i get my hymns from him
so its not me its he thats lyrical
im not a miracle im a heaven sent instrument
my rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
for your soul and your mental
thats why im instrumental vibrations is what im into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that aint what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
im trying to get us us free like cinque
i cant stop thats why im hot
determination dedication motivation
im talking to you of my many inspirations
when i say i cant let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
and if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
in my grip i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it be known that gods penmanship has been signed
with a language called love
thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
and while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess im one of a kind in a full house
cause whenever i open my heart my soul or my mouth

when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing i found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down
get up i get get up i get

id like to propose a toast

so get your ass up off the wall

the all around the world digital underground pac
the rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the roc
i take my chain my fifteen seconds of fame
aint nobody expect kanye to end up on top
they expected that college dropout to drop and then flop
then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
my money was thinner than sean pauls goatee hair
now jean paul gaultier cologne fill the air here
they say he bougie he bigheaded
would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
flow infectious give me ten seconds
ill have a buzz bigger than insects in texas
its funny how wasnt nobody interested

so get your ass up off the wall

now was kanye the most overlooked yes sir
now is kanye the most overbooked yes sir
though the fans want the feeling of a tribe called quest
but all they got left is this guy called west
thatll take freeway throw him on tracks with mos def
call him kwali or kweli i put him on songs with jayz
im the gap like banana republic and old navy and ooh
it come out sweeter than old sadie
nice as bunb when i met him at the source awards
girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
and i was almost famous now everybody love kanye im almost raymond
some say he arrogant can yall blame him
it was straight embarrassing how yall played him
last year shoppin my demo i was tryin to shine
now i could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
i use it as my gas so they say that im gassed
but without it id be last so i ought to laugh
so i dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
im kan the louis vuitton don
bought my mom a purse now she louis vuitton mom
i aint play the hand i was dealt i changed my cards
i prayed to the skies and i changed my stars
i went to the malls and i balled too hard
oh my god is that a black card
i turned around and replied why yes
but i prefer the term african american express
brains power and muscle like dame puffy and russell
your boy back on his hustle you know what ive been up to
mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips

so get your ass up off the wall all

so this aampr over at rocafella named hip hop picked the truth beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me you know like i always do
i play the songs hes like who that spittin im like its me hes like oh well okay
uh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth
just askin me to send him beats and im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with
and um he was friends with my mentor no id
and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap
i was all i dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
i was messin with uh ddot also
people were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how i got in the game
if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here
i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and be able to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample
and at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me
so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic  at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled
and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life
and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management
i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude
and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take
and he said tell me what you think of this
and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz
i aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion
so he asked me what you think of it
you know what im sayin man what imma tell him
i was on the train man you know
so after that i went back home and man im im just in chicago im trying to do my thing
you know i got groups i got acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been
one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed
but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company
so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company
and i got evicted at the same time
so i went down and tracked the beats from him
so i aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk
me and my mother drove to newark new jersey
i hadnt even seen my apartment
you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city
and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats
and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time
but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
i remember it like like it was yesterday
and hip hop said yo play that one beat for him
so i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx
and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like ooh
two days later im in baseline and i seen dame
dame didnt know who i was and i was like yo whats up im kanye
so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days
i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story
the day i did the cant be life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly
and hip hop was there i think tyty john meneilly a bunch of people
i didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap
mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips
and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line
that was it you know i aint get no deal then haha
okay fast forward
so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single
and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
man yo i appreciate i love him for that
and at this time you know i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these aamprs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up id play them some beats
gimme a beat that sound like jayz you know they dick riders whatever
be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they didnt sign me
im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
lets just say i didnt get my deal
the person who actually kicked everything off was joe h from capitol records
he wanted to sign me really bad
dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure its not wack
then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs cause you know cam was in the room young guru and
dame was in the room
so i played actually its a song that youll never hear but maybe i might use it
so its called wow
i go to jacob with twentyfive thou you go with  hundred wow
i got eleven plaques on my walls right now
dont bite that chorus i might still use it
i aint gonna front its kinda hot
like they still werent looking at me like a rapper
and im sure dame figured like man if he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album you know
so uh dame took me into the office and hes like yo man b b you dont want a brick you dont want a brick
you gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on
i told hip hop and hip hop was all oh word
actually even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with h
that you know cause i told him i was gonna do it and im a man of my word i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do
then you know im not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a producer rapper and told h that told the heads of the capitol and right
the day im talking about i planned out everything i was gonna do man i had picked out clothes
i already started booking studio sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man i was ready to go
and they had mel call me they said yo
capitol pulled on the deal
and you know i told them that rocafella was interested
and i dont know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever
i went up
i called g i said man you think we could still get that deal with rocafella

the disco ball in my mouth insinuates im ballin

thats ordinary from the start
we looked for stranger things

like im picturing now

castles glitter under spanish skies
snow white mountains in a foreign state
tell me someday well get there
someday

underneath your window
just in case you dont know
i can see it
you cast an unfamiliar day glow
different than what i know
shining like a halo
i can feel it

we turned our back on ordinary from the start
we looked for stranger things
cause thats just who we are
found me the edge of something beautiful and loud

castles glitter under spanish skies
snow white mountains in an ancient place

i had a dream i was mugged outside your house
i had a dream in a panic you came running out
for a moment you were sure id die on you
for a moment i believed you loved me too
but life is never like this and youre never strong

too much of a good thing wont be good for long
although you made my heart sing to stay with you would be wrong
too much of a good thing wont be good anymore
watch where i tread before i fall

wed talk maybe  times a day
and still i never say what i want to say
i thought i wouldnt need to
i guess i read you wrong

too much of a good thing wont be good for long
although you made my heart sing to stay with you would be wrong
too much of a good thing wont be good anymore
watch where i tread before i fall

you refuse to see this dont see it anymore
i have made the decision not to answer your calls
cause i put everything out there and i got nothing at all

too much of a good thing isnt good and you know
i watch where i walk before i fall
before i fall


but i still need love cause im just a man
i dont want you to leave will you hold my hand

oh wont you stay with me
cause youre all i need
this aint love its clear to see
but darling stay with me

why am i so emotional
no its not a good look gain some self control
and deep down i know this never works
but you can lay with me so it doesnt hurt

oh wont you stay with me
cause youre all i need
this aint love its clear to see
but darling stay with me

oh wont you stay with me
cause youre all i need
this aint love its clear to see
but darling stay with me

oh wont you stay with me
cause youre all i need
this aint love its clear to see
but darling stay with me


i dont have much to give but i dont care for gold
what use is money when you need someone to hold
dont have direction im just rolling down this road
waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

pack up and leave everything dont you see what i can bring
cant keep this beating heart at bay
leave your lover leave him for me

we sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
im in love with you and you will never know
but if i cant have you ill walk this life alone
spare you the rising storms and let the river flow
or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

pack up and leave everything dont you see what i can bring
cant keep this beating heart at bay
leave your lover leave him for me
leave your lover leave him for me


you and me we made a vow
for better or for worse
i cant believe you let me down
but the proofs in the way it hurts

for months on end ive had my doubts
denying every tear
i wish this would be over now
but i know that i still need you here

you say im crazy
cause you dont think i know what youve done
but when you call me baby
i know im not the only one

youve been so unavailable
now sadly i know why
your heart is unobtainable
even though god knows you have mine

you say im crazy
cause you dont think i know what youve done
but when you call me baby
i know im not the only one

i have loved you for many years
maybe i am just not enough
youve made me realize my deepest fear
by lying and tearing us up

you say im crazy
cause you dont think i know what youve done
but when you call me baby
i know im not the only one

you say im crazy
cause you dont think i know what youve done
but when you call me baby
i know im not the only one
i know im not the only one
i know im not the only one
and i know and i know and i know
and i know and i know and i dont know
i know im not the only one


you know what i mean
its like walking in the heat all day with no water
its like waiting for a friend
watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
or losing in an argument
although youre right cant get your thoughts in order

still i refrain
from talking at you talking on
you know me well
i dont explain

but what the hell
why do you think i come round here on my free will
wasting all my precious time
oh the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh oh ive
ive told you now

you know what i mean
although i try my best i still let down the team
youre everything i want
why should i resist when you are there for me

should i refrain
from talking at you talking on
you know me well
i dont explain

but what the hell
why do you think i come round here on my free will
wasting all my precious time
oh the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh oh ive
ive told you now

ive told you now
and ive told you now
and ive told you now

still i refrain
from talking at you talking on
you know me well
i dont explain

so what the hell
why do you think i come round here on my free will
wasting all my precious time
what the hell
why do you think i come round here on my own will
wasting all my precious time
oh the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh oh ive
ive told you now


he could be a sinner or a gentleman
he could be your preacher when your soul is damned
he could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
hell never love you like i can can

he could be a stranger you gave a second glance
he could have your humour that i dont understand cause
hell never love you like i can can can

why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
hell never love you like i can can can
hell never love you like i can can

a chance encounter of circumstance
maybe hes a mantra keeps your mind entranced
he could be the silence in this mayhem but then again
hell never love you like i can can can

why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
hell never love you like i can can can
hell never love you like i can can can
hell never love you like i can can can

we both have demons that we cant stand
i love your demons like devils can
if youre still seeking an honest man
and stop deceiving lord please

why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
hell never love you like i can can can
hell never love you like i can can can
hell never love you like i can can can


ive been sleeping with the lights on

because i built this bed for two
im just waiting on your answer

that one day i will be where i was
right there right next to you
and its hard the days just seem so dark
the moon the stars are nothing without you
your touch your skin where do i begin
no words can explain the way im missing you
these tears they tell their own story

you told me not to cry when you were gone
but the feelings overwhelming its much too strong
can i lay by your side next to you you
and make sure youre alright
ill take care of you

im reaching out to you
can you hear my call
this hurt that ive been through
im missing you missing you like crazy daily

can i lay by your side next to you you
and make sure youre alright
ill take care of you

can i lay by your side next to you you
and make sure youre alright

ive gotta get out of here
this towns no longer fun
and im falling closer falling closer
closer to the sun
ive gotta get out of here
come kiss another face
cause it hurts too bad it hurts too bad
and i dont like the taste

you say its over leaving me so far from sober
now summer is colder i lean on a strangers shoulder
i walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smoulder
without a trace im under

and god knows i try
but each time i do
it only reminds me of you
it only reminds me of you

ive gotta get out of here
cause youll never want me back
you are moving on moving on
and im stuck on the track
ive gotta get out of here
before i selfdestruct
and i dont want and i dont want
my heart to ever stop

i walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smolder
without a trace im under

and god knows i try
but each time i do
it only reminds me of you
it only reminds me of you

and god knows i try
but each time i do
it only reminds me of you
it only reminds me of you

it only reminds me of you


my mind runs away to you
with the thought i hope youll see
cant see where its wandered too
but i know where it wants to be

im waiting patiently though time is moving slow
i have one vacancy and i wanted you to know that

youre the one designed for me
a distant stranger that i will complete
i know youre out there were meant to be
so keep your hair down and make it to me
and make it to me

so sick of this lonely air
it seems such a waste of breath
so much that i need to say
so much to get off my chest

im waiting patiently though time is moving slow
i have one vacancy and i wanted you to know that

youre the one designed for me
a distant stranger that i will complete
i know youre out there were meant to be
so keep your hair down and make it to me
make it to me
make it to me
make it to me

even though you mean the most to me
cause every time i open up it hurts
so im never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt

and every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out the less i love you

i see you in the morning feel your fingers in my hair
sometimes i still pretend youre all there
it hits me without warning your reflection walking by
but i know its only in my mind

will you show me the piece of my heart ive been missing
wont you give me the part of myself that i cant get back
will you show me the piece of my heart ive been missing
cause id kill for you and darling you know that

so ill light up a cigarette
ill drink it down till theres nothing left
cause i sure cant get no sleep
and lord knows theres no relief

you held my heart in your fingertips
so now i drown in my bitterness
oh i cant get no sleep
and i sure wont i sure wont find no peace
no peace

all that i am asking is for a little clarity
thats all that really matters to me
in and out of focus tears are in my eyes
were burning down the bridges this time

will you show me the piece of my heart ive been missing
wont you give me the part of myself that i cant give back
will you show me the piece of my heart ive been missing
cause id kill for you and darling you know that

so ill light up a cigarette
ill drink it down till theres nothing left
cause i sure cant get no sleep
and lord knows theres no relief

you held my heart in your fingertips
so now i drown in my bitterness

caught up in the wonder of your charms
oh ill cry for you ill cry for you
ill lie for you ill lie for you
but i dont even know you anymore

so ill light up a cigarette
ill drink it down till theres nothing left

now im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
see me lose focus as i sing to you loud
and i cant no i wont hush
ill say the words that make you blush
im gonna sing this now

see im true my songs are where my heart is
im like glue i stick to other artists
im not you now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see im real i do it all its all me
im not fake dont ever call me lazy
i wont stay put give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you

you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me

i sing and write my own tune
and i write my own verse hell
dont need another wordsmith to make my tune sell
call yourself a singerwriter youre just bluffing
your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
i will blast and i didnt go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act right
i cant last if im smoking on a crack pipe

and i wont be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia
and musically im demonstrating
when i perform live feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
a young singerwriter like gabriella cilmi

cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you

you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me

cause with the lyrics ill be aiming it right
i wont stop till my names in light
at stadium heights with damien rice
because im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
never be anything but a singersongwriter
the games over but now im on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal

people think that im bound to blow up
ive done around about a thousand shows
but i havent got a house plus i live on the couch

from day one ive been prepared
with vo wax for my ginger hair
so now im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
cause its another day
plus ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rappers shoes using new laces
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide till were just jack soon as i get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
im still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
im still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
im always doing shows if im not im in the studio
truly broke never growing up call me ruffio
melody music maker
reading all the papers

cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you

you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you


filled up with doubt
i have to move home
but i want to stay with you
for all of the summer
i have my plan
that you wont remember
if you want to see the world
then please ask your mother
i cannot hold your hand
to watch you go
i am a liar
as you might know
i need you now
i need your touch
and your lips
i need that smile
and your kiss

youre so cool

i see your grace
from my window

of you in september

to watch you go
i am a liar
as you might know
i need you now
i need your touch
and your lips
i need that smile
and your kiss

youre so cool
youre so beautiful

youre so cool
youre so beautiful
youre so

unhappy days
that left us on the floor
and youd breathe me
til youre not feeling sure
everything will brighten up
if we go to brighton ill take you along the pier
everything will lighten up
if you feel too frightened ill make it disappear

darling dont be nervous
ill understand if you let me go
i did this on purpose now

when im missing you
ill stop eating food
and ill squeeze in to a dress so i can be like you
and then ill see your bitterness
and why youre leaving too
maybe ill put you to a test and say that i love you
i think that i love you

sunny days
that left my skin blood red
and you squeeze me
til these thoughts leave my head
if it gets too complicated
ill give up and be frustrated
can you see whats wrong
if you feel like youve been hated
this loves too overrated
see whats going on on

darling dont be nervous
ill understand if you let me go
i did this on purpose now

when im missing you
ill stop eating food
and ill squeeze in to a dress so i can be like you
and then ill see your bitterness
and why youre leaving too
maybe ill put you to a test and say that i love you
i think that i love you

take me back to live at home
take me back to albert road
now im missing you
ive stopped eating food
and ive squeezed in to your dress so i can feel like you
but then i saw your bitterness and why you left me too
i thought ill put you to a test and say that i love you
i think that i love you

and ive stopped eating food
and ive squeezed in to your dress
so i could feel like you
but then i saw your bitterness
and why you left me too
maybe ill put you to a test and say that i love you
now it seems you loved me too


this city never sleeps
i hear the people walk by when its late
sirens beat through my windowsill
i cant close my eyes
dont control what im into

and this tower is alive
with lights that are blinding me awake
hood up and lace untied
the sleep fills my mind
cant control what im into

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the back seat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

the pavement is my friend
it will take me where i need to go
i find it trips me up
and puts me down
this is not what im used to

and the shop across the road
fills my needs and gives me company
when i need it
voices beat through my walls
i dont think im gonna make it
past tomorrow

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in a back seat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

and my lungs hurt
and my ears bled
with the sounds of the city life
echoed in my head
do i need this
to keep me alive
the traffic stops and starts
but i need to move alone

london calls me a stranger
this is not my home
home

im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in a back seat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two


youre not her
though i try to see you differently
i tow the line
see im searching for what used to be mine

i saw your eyes and then i saw alice staring back at me
and i will try to find another one whos suited to me
as well as her

ive moved far away from you and i want to see you here
beside me dear but things arent clear

when we never even tried we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful whenever i was away
id miss you
i miss you

she was mine i was hers and all thats in between
when she would cry i would shelter her and keep her
from the darkness that will be

if i moved far away from you and i want to see you here
beside me dear but things arent clear woah

when we never even tried we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful whenever i was away
id miss you
and i miss you

dont drop me in its not my turn
if you cut deep then i might learn
if you scar and leave me like sunburn

dont drop me in its not my time
if you cut deep then i might learn
you scarred and left me like sunburn

when we never even tried we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful whenever i was away
id miss you
and i miss you


you and i
two of a mind
this loves
one of a kind
you and i
were drifting
over the edge
and i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you
would you fall too

you and i
learning to speak
with kisses on cheek
were lifted
over the edge
and i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you
would you fall too

i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you


the rain wont stop falling
its harder than before
this car keeps on stalling
pedal to the floor

what i need to know
is if you love me and i
really need to know
is if you want me when you call
if you want me when you call

we were young and we were foolish
school books in our arms
dodging homework dodging classes
to set off fire alarms

and what i need to know
is if you love me and i
really need to know
if you need me when you call
if you want me when you call

we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away


what i need to know
is if you love me and i
really need to know
if you need me when you call
if you want me when you call


and i will lie with you
i start to feel those butterflies
when im next to you

tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you
do i hate you
i cant make up my mind
so lets freefall
see where we land

its been this way since we were young
well fight and then make up
ill breathe your air into my lungs
when i feel your touch

tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you
do i hate you
i cant make up my mind
so lets freefall


shes like cold coffee in the morning
shell make me shiver without warning
and make me laugh as if im in on the joke

and you can stay with me forever
or you could stay with me for now

tell me if im wrong
tell me if im right
tell me if you need a loving hand
tell me if i know
tell me if i do
tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

ill wake with coffee in the morning
but she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
outside the day is up and calling
but i dont have to be so please go back to sleep

stay with me forever
or you could stay with me for now

tell me if im wrong

tell me if im right
tell me if you need a loving hand
tell me if i know
tell me if i do
tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

cause i love the way you wake me up
for goodness sake will my love not be enough

tell me if im wrong
tell me if im right
tell me if you need a loving hand
tell me if i know
tell me if i do
tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

tell me if im wrong
tell me if im right
tell me if you need a loving hand


i paid all my dues
and she wanted to know
that id never leave her
now im ready to go
as strange as it seems
shes endless to me
shes just like paperwork but harder to read

patiences my enemy
lovings my friend
its harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend

oh she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself

i made all my plans
and as she has made hers
she kept me in mind
but i wasnt sure
i searched every room
for a way to escape
but every time i try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight
and blocking my way

patiences my enemy

lovings my friend
its harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend

oh she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself

and like the back of her hand she already understands everything
wont you stay she says
and she already knows how it goes
and where she stands ill stay anyway

cause she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself
oh she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself
i know myself

oh she knows me like i know myself
i know myself
i know myself
i know myself


ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh

i am a poor wayfaring stranger
travelling through this world alone
theres no sickness toil or danger
and that bright laight to which i go
and im going there to see my mother
and im going there no more to roam
im only going over jordan
im only going over home now

heyey yeah
ooh

i know dark clouds will gather me
i know my ways rough and steep
and the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
and i know my ways rough and steep
im going there to see my mother
im going there no more to roam
im only going over jordan
im only going over home now

cause i am a poor wayfaring stranger
travelling through this world alone
theres no sickness toil or danger
and that bright laight to which i go
im going there to see my mother
im going there no more to roam
im only going over jordan
im only going home now


i found your hairband on my bedroom floor
the only evidence that youve been ere before
and i dont get waves of missing you anymore
theyre more like tsunami tides in my eyes

never getting dry so i get high
smoke in the day then i sleep with the light on
weeks pass in the blink of an eye

i dont drink like everybody else
end up forgetting things about myself
i stumble and fall with the head spin ive got
my minds with you but my hearts just not

so am i close to you anymore now its over
and theres no chance that well work it out
thats why you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied

everybody said that well be together forever
but i know that i never wanna settle down
come around break up the love like lego now
never wanna turn into another like you

sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
everythings great but everythings short
but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus
now im in position to be another stalker
and everything i say seems to always sound awkward

like our last kiss it was perfect
but we were nervous on the surface
and im always saying every day that it was worth it
pain is only relevant if it still hurts
i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
and go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

so am i close to you anymore now its over
and theres no chance that well work it out
oh you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied

because if i was gonna go somewhere id be there by now
and maybe i can let myself down oh
and im thinking that i am unaware i keep my feet on the ground
i keep looking around to make sure im not
the only one to feel low

because if you want ill take you in my arms
and keep you sheltered from all that ive done wrong
and i know youll say that im the only one
but i know god made another one of me
to love you better than i ever will

cause you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied


now im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
see me lose focus as i sing to you loud
and i cant no i wont hush
ill say the words that make you blush
im gonna sing this now

see im true my songs are where my heart is
im like glue i stick to other artists
im not you now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see im real i do it all its all me
im not fake dont ever call me lazy
i wont stay put give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you

you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me

i sing and write my own tune
and i write my own verse hell
dont need another wordsmith to make my tune sell
call yourself a singerwriter youre just bluffing
your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
i will blast and i didnt go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act right
i cant last if im smoking on a crack pipe

and i wont be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia
and musically im demonstrating
when i perform live feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
a young singerwriter like gabriella cilmi

cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you

you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me

cause with the lyrics ill be aiming it right
i wont stop till my names in light
at stadium heights with damien rice
because im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
never be anything but a singersongwriter
the games over but now im on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal

people think that im bound to blow up
ive done around about a thousand shows
but i havent got a house plus i live on the couch

from day one ive been prepared
with vo wax for my ginger hair
so now im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
cause its another day
plus ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rappers shoes using new laces
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide till were just jack soon as i get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
im still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
im still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
im always doing shows if im not im in the studio
truly broke never growing up call me ruffio
melody music maker

cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you

you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you


white lips pale face breathing in snowflakes
burnt lungs sour taste
lights gone days end struggling to pay rent

and they say shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream been this way since 
but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

cause were just under the upperhand
and go mad for a couple grams

and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
its too cold outside for angels to fly
angels to fly

ripped gloves raincoat tried to swim stay afloat
dry house wet clothes
loose change bank notes wearyeyed dry throat
call girl no phone

and they say shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream been this way since 
but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

cause were just under the upperhand
and go mad for a couple grams

and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
sells love to another man
its too cold outside for angels to fly

an angel will die covered in white
closed eye and hoping for a better life
straight down the line

and they say shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream been this way since 
but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

and were all under the upper hand
go mad for a couple grams

in a pipe fly to the motherland
or sell love to another man
its too cold outside for angels to fly
angels to fly

to fly fly
for angels to fly
to fly to fly
angels to die


i wanna be drunk when i wake up
on the right side of the wrong bed
and never an excuse that i made up
tell you the truth that i want
didnt kill me it never made me stronger at all

love will scare your makeup
lip sticks to me so now i maybe lean back there
im sat here wishing i was sober
and no ill never hold you like i used to

but the house gets cold when you cut the heating
without you to hold ill be freezing
cant rely on the heart to beating
cause you take part of it every evening
take words out of my mouth just from breathing
replace with phrases like when you leaving me

should i should i
maybe ill get drunk again
ill be drunk again
ill be drunk again
to feel a little love

i wanna hold your heart in both hands
not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
and i got no plans for the weekend
so should we speak then keep it between friends
though i know youll never love me like you used to

there maybe other people like us
who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
flames just create us but burns dont heal like before
and you dont hold me anymore

on cold days cold plays out like the bands name
i know i cant heal things with a handshake
you know i can change as i began saying
you cut me wide open like landscape
open bottles of beer but never champagne
to applaud you with the sound that my hands make

should i should i
maybe ill get drunk again
ill be drunk again
ill be drunk again
to feel a little love

all by myself im here again
all by myself you know ill never change
all by myself
all by myself

im just drunk again
ill be drunk again
ill be drunk again
to feel a little love

my mind is a warrior
my heart is a foreigner
my eyes are the colour of red like a sunset
ill never keep it bottled up
and left to the hands of the coroner
be a true heart not a follower
were not done yet

and if we should ever do this right
im never gonna let you down
ill never let you down
well keep it on the downlow
and ill keep you around so ill know
that ill never let you down
ill never let you down

youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade  but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
now youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade  but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down now

my eyes are a river filler
this drink is a liver killer
my chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again
your body is my ballpoint pen
and your mind is my new best friend
your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again

and if we should ever do this right
im never gonna let you down
ill never let you down
ill keep it on the downlow
and ill keep you around so ill know
that ill never let you down
ill never let you down

youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade  but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade  but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now and ill never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now and ill never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now and ill never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now and ill never let you down

youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade  but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade  but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down


i should ink my skin with your name
and take my passport out again
and just replace it
see i could do without a tan
on my left hand
where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
and i should run you a hot bath
fill it up with bubbles

cause maybe youre loveable
maybe youre my snowflake
and your eyes turn from green to gray
and in the winter ill hold you in a cold place
and you should never cut your hair
cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder

and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe im just in love
when you wake me up

and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
could you make me a cup of tea
to open my eyes in the right way
and i know you love shrek
because weve watched it  times
and maybe were hoping for a fairytale too
and if your dvd breaks today
you shouldve got a vcr
because ive never owned a blue ray true say

because your brother always beats me
and if i lost i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv
and then you laugh at me
and be asking me
if ima be home next week
and then you lie with me till i fall asleep
and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe im just in love
when you wake me up

and i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try to get me to stop
but you drink as much as me
and i get drunk a lot
so i take you to the beach
and walk along the sand
and ill make you a heart pendant
with a pebble held in my hand
and ill carve it like this necklace
so the heart falls where your chest is
now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
and it falls just where it needs to be
and rests peacefully
so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
against yours now
maybe im just in love when you wake me up
maybe im just in love when you wake me up
maybe i fell in love when you woke me up


youre just a small bump unborn
in four months youre brought to life
you might be left with my hair
but youll have your mothers eyes

ill hold your body in my hands
be as gentle as i can
but for now youre a scan of my unmade plans
a small bump in four months youre brought to life

and ill whisper quietly
and give you nothing but truth
if youre not inside me
ill put my future in you

you are my one and only and you can wrap your fingers
round my thumb and hold me tight
you are my one and only you can wrap your fingers
round my thumb and hold me tight and youll be alright

youre just a small bump unknown
youll grow into your skin
with a smile like hers
and a dimple beneath your chin

fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
and eyelids closed to be soon open wide
a small bump in four months
youll open your eyes

and ill hold you tightly
and tell you nothing but truth
if youre not inside me
ill put my future in you

you are my one and only and you can wrap your fingers
round my thumb and hold me tight and youll be alright

then you can lie with me with your tiny feet
when youre half asleep ill leave you be
right in front of me for a couple weeks
so i could keep you safe

cause you are my one and only and you can wrap your fingers
round my thumb and hold me tight
you are my one and only you can wrap your fingers
round my thumb and hold me tight and youll be alright

cause you were just a small bump unborn
for four months then torn from life
maybe you were needed up there
but were still unaware as why


this is the start of something beautiful
this is the start of something new
you are the one that made me lose it all
you are the the start of something new

and ill throw it all away
watched you fall into my arms again
and ill throw it all away
watch you fall now

you are the earth i will stand on
you are the words i will sing

and id thrown it all away
watched you fall into his arms again
and id thrown it all away
watched you fall now

and take me back
and take me home
watch me fall down to earth
take me back home

this is the start of something beautiful
you are the start of something new


this city never sleeps
i hear the people walk by when its late
sirens beat through my windowsill
i cant close my eyes
dont control what im into

and this tower is alive
with lights that are blinding me awake
hood up and lace untied
the sleep fills my mind
cant control what im into

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the back seat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

the pavement is my friend
it will take me where i need to go
i find it trips me up
and puts me down
this is not what im used to

and the shop across the road
fills my needs and gives me company
when i need it
voices beat through my walls
i dont think im gonna make it
past tomorrow

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in a back seat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

and my lungs hurt
and my ears bled
with the sounds of the city life
echoed in my head
do i need this
to keep me alive
the traffic stops and starts
but i need to move alone

london calls me a stranger
this is not my home
home

im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in a back seat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

another day another life
passes by just like mine
its not complicated

another mind
another soul
another body to grow old
its not complicated

do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you
float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

another tear
another cry
another place for us to die
its not complicated

another life thats gone to waste
another light lost from your face
its complicated

is it only wonder or do birds still sing for you
float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

ooh how i miss you
my symphony places the song that carries you out
ooh how i miss you
i miss you and i wish youd stay

is it any wonder that the stars shine out for you
float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

ooh oh ooh oh
ooh oh ooh oh

touch down
like a seven four seven
stay out and well live forever now

she left a note ill be back in five
well im still waiting for that moment to arrive

and i was told to put my job in front of you
but it wont hold me like you do

but i do it for the love
waiting on the gold rush
keep it on the edge
smoking on a rollup
when i see my friends
all they say is hold up
ed remember the time
when we were in school
listening to grownups
didnt learn a thing
but then again you know what
you know how to sing
but you dont know anything other than that
so maybe you should learn to love her
like like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like like the way you wanna be loved

i never told her that i liked
the way she dances slightly out of time
and pretends she knows the words
to a song she never heard
but i tell her all the time

well i was told to put my job in front of you
but it wont hold me like you do

and i will try to find another one whos suited to me
as well as her

when we never even tried we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful whenever i was away

she was mine i was hers and all thats in between
when she would cry i would shelter her and keep her
from the darkness that will be

if i moved far away from you and i want to see you here
beside me dear but things arent clear woah

we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful whenever i was away

if you cut deep then i might learn
if you scar and leave me like sunburn

we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful whenever i was away

patiently listening to the sighs

i found out
to make his demons

they snatched her willingly she left
they wondered why shed accepted that
she knew that shed be saved but how
she knew that future kid was on the prowl

i found out
we could both run wild
i found out
me and futures child

i found out
i found out

we filled the day with careless displays
going sailing with nothing to say
when i fell
we could tell

now youre torn apart
the suns driving fast
taking photographs
its morning at last
and the sailors are taking a stand
with their heads buried deep in the sand

feeling well
life is swell
when i fell
we could tell
hooray
when i fell
we could tell
feeling well
life is swell


your wind blows
your mind falls down
just give me
the time to drown

your wind blows
your mind falls down
just give me
the time to drown

the boys are
digging the ground
but i cant stop spinning around

one day you will let me be
what i wanted you to be

the boys are
stopping the ground
from taking
those things we found
someday you will let me see
all of the things we used to see

someday you will let me be
all of the things we used to be
someday you will let me be
the champ you wanted her to see


i once heard captain dan tell me a story
about this lovely girl whos name was jane
she was vast and deep and filled with glory

ah

bottom served as home for hull and anchor
shes always fit to quarrel with the wind
the great titanic yes its she that sank her

ah

then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear

i love you
my ocean blue
i like the way your sea sees me
my darling jane
she speaks to me at times through falling rain

now twas time to manifest her vigor
was she fit to quarrel with the wind
the air was strong but jane she was much bigger

ah

then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear

i love you
my ocean blue
i like the way your sea sees me
my darling jane
oh me my darling jane
oh me and my darling jane
she speaks to me at times through falling rain
speaks to me at times through falling rain


nobody cares
about ocean affairs
hes by himself cause nobody loves him
cleaning his sand
filled boots with his hand
looking for something but nothing sees him

happy was he
in spite of his knee
that wasnt there because of his day job
there was a man
who took to the band
paying attention tried to adhere him

and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled finding a plan

seemingly fine
he slipped on his wine
terra was healthy but not on a mission

there was a sea
a mythical tease
our cannons were shot
till we couldnt afford them

others would have died alone
angels all worked free
timeless fairs and singalongs
speaking naturally

and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
all the way
from the bay
i could hear them say
all the time
we were dead
and im cap splendid

and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
all the way
from the bay
i could hear them say
i dont care
if were dead
and im cap splendid


have you seen buddy two shoes wilson
he comes around bout everyday
if you just sit on down and listen
youd figure out what im trying to say

have you seen buddy two shoes wilson
he comes around bout everyday
if you just sit on down and listen
youd figure out what im trying to say


i wake up
thoughts of you
tattooed to my mind
as i wonder
what to wear
what to eat
who to be
will i see you again

and as my car breaks down
i shake my head and say
what a day

if you only knew
what i went through just to get to you
im hanging from you
and ill hold on if you want me to

every bus every train
ever cab every lane is jammed
so i look to the sky
and i reach for the planes with my hands

if all my days go wrong
it went right

if you only knew
what i went through just to get to you
im hanging from you
and ill hold on if you want me to

if you only knew
what i went through just to get to you
im swinging from you
and theres nothing i would rather do


here in this town they have all got the blues
as the paperboy takes off without any news
angels have wings you can feel free to use
the corner store drugs you can freely abuse

and im yelling and screaming cause
baby youre driving me crazy

so life on your own has been vacant and cold
everyones getting somewhere and youre getting old
career opportunities they all have been sold
along with your body and most of your soul

and im yelling and screaming cause
baby youre driving me crazy

if i could spare more remorse
from my emptied out pores
i would maybe

cause the fogs getting thicker
and the worlds spinning fast
the chaos is building
its going to last
and its so hard to see
and youre so hard to find
theyre days when i think i am losing my mind

so keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes
striking the canvas with deep blues and greens
realists are frowning they think youre obscene
as you work overtime to make sure they can dream

and im yelling and screaming cause
baby youre driving me crazy

if i could spare more remorse
from my emptied out pores
i would maybe

cause the fogs getting thicker
and the worlds spinning fast
the chaos is building
its going to last
and its so hard to see
and youre so hard to find
theyre days when i think i am losing my mind

and we yell
and we scream

as the fogs getting thicker
the worlds spinning fast
the chaos is building
its going to last
and its so hard to see
and youre so hard to find
theyre days when i think i am losing my mind

and the fogs getting thicker
the worlds spinning fast
the chaos is building
its going to last
and its so hard to see
and youre so hard to find
theres days when i think i am losing my mind


leaning on a tree trunk
thinking all the same junk
fallin in and out of a dream

back and forth im swaying
im contemplating staying
laying and decaying when i know i must leave

where do i aim when i shoot the breeze
how do i call myself at times like these

i need a simple kind of lovely
the thought is just a novelty

you can spend the whole time
standin underneath you when they cut you free

what about when the sun leaves
and what about all those bad dreams
who will walk you back into reality

i wish this could be like this everyday
but i know that i could never live this way
was just a simple kind of lovely
the memories will be okay

i wish things could be like this everyday
but i know i could never live this way
was just a simple kind of lovely
and the memories will be okay

was jus a simle kind of lovely
and the memories will be okay


as we kicked around downtown waiting for the sun to rise
we watched the clouds
take the shape of a chevrolet
and the way that im feeling is the color of my lovers eyes
she caught me lookin the other way
thinkin finally of our better days

as she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
dont know how long well be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
and well be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck

trippin on a flat tire
dial up the triple a
time is running out for our escape
so much for that chevrolet
eyes shut tight as we venture to another place
as we listen to the music play
i cant remember what i had to say

as she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
dont know how long well be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
and well be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck

as she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
dont know how long well be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
and well be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck


ive taken time
to think about the words ive said and what they mean
and ive realized that having you is just like having everything

but when i see you dancing there
i get up and throw my hands in the air
when ive nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home

its been so long
it seems the only things i know are far from home
where did i go
it seems sometimes im only good at being gone

but when i see you dancing there
i get up and throw my hands in the air
when ive nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home

but when i see you standing there
i get up and throw my hands in the air
when ive nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home

when ive nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home
home home
when ive nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home


every day people sway
softly lulling me to sleep
i look the other way
but i still cant look too deep
i think ill fall asleep
i think ill fall asleep

so call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everythings gonna be fine

gently lulling me to sleep
what gives me the right
to waste away and weep
i think ill turn away
theres nothing left to say

so call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everythings gonna be fine
so you wanna have everything your heart desires
theres a fist full of people with their hearts on fire
make your way on up to the front of the line

get out of my way
im here now to stay
get out of my way
im here now to stay

so call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everythings gonna be fine
so you wanna have everything your heart desires
theres a fist full of people with their hearts on fire
make your way on up to the front of the line


you have this way of dipping in and out of sight as things collide
and you have this way of falling in and out of time as it goes by
passing silently with no goodbye
and ive spoken with all the other angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them wholeheartedly i do

telegram came today from a friend saying
where in the hell have you been
where are you goin
i said i dont know does the loneliness show
and if so does it ever end
and ive spoken with all the other angels
and they dont know what to do
and i agree with them wholeheartedly i do

you have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me at the same time
returning my hellos with goodbyes
cause ive spoken with all the other angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them wholeheartedly i do

cause ive spoken with all the other angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them wholeheartedly i do

and ive spoken with all the other angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them wholeheartedly i do


she sits all alone reading books and drinkin wine
admires all the cracks by the doorway
she tries to look happy but shes slowly running out of smiles
gracefully wasting away

who is gonna make the birds sing
who is gonna be her everything
everyday goodbyes

she foolishly tries to convince herself that shell be fine
she blows all her kisses to no one
as the phone rings again she just closes her eyes
she covers her ears and screams please not today

who is gonna make the birds sing
who is gonna be her everything
everyday goodbyes

she cries and then she sighs
and gets down on her knees yelling i dont believe what has happened to me
she cries and then she sighs
and gets down on her knees yelling i dont believe what has happened to me

who is gonna make the birds sing
who is gonna be her everything
everyday goodbyes


 alright
 i read the news today oh boy
 about a lucky man who made the grade
 i told you i was gonna run out of rhythm
 i read the news today oh boy
 about a lucky man who made the grade
 and though the news was rather sad


how dare you say that my behaviors unacceptable
so condescending unnecessarily critical
i have the tendency of getting very physical
so watch your step cause if i do youll need a miracle

you drain me dry and make me wonder why im even here
this double vision i was seein is finally clear
you want to stay but you know very well i want you gone

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

is there anyone out there
cause its gettin harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its gettin harder and harder to breathe

what you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
you should know better you never listened to a word i said
clutchin your pillow and writhin in a naked sweat
hoping somebody someday will do you like i did

and when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

say is there anyone out there
cause its gettin harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its gettin harder and harder to breathe

does it kill does it burn
is it painful to learn that its me that has all the control
does it thrill does it sting
when you feel what i bring and you wish that you had me to hold

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

say is there anyone out there
cause its gettin harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its gettin harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its gettin harder and harder to breathe


i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart

oh this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breakin in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
whoa whoa whoa

i tried my best to feed her appetite
so hard to keep her satisfied
oh kept playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again

but uhoh this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breakin in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
whoa whoa whoa

ill fix these broken things
repair your broken wings
my pressure on your hips
im sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you
cause i know thats what you want me to do

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breakin in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and my heart is breakin in front of me
she said goodbye too many times before

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breakin in front of me
but i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore


you build me up you knock me down
provoke a smile then make me frown
you are the queen of runaround
you know its true

you chew me up you spit me out
enjoy the taste i leave in your mouth
you look at me i look at you
neither of us know what to do

and there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess id better find a new way in
and i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you but its not the same

back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on

i cannot forget refuse to regret

theres lights that line these halls
that beckon us to stay
a glimmer in the distance
that gathers all the stray
and when i need it most
it breaks into a song
that runs through all my veins
and helps me to hold on

we ran along into the spotlight
you sang a song that made the children cry
and all the people knew my name
it was a bright light
these lands combine into a great big mass
we sang along to the very last
oh the jury stole my fame
and then we grabbed the sun
and it shined into these eyes
believe me

cover up rain down
we wept on the edge of this town
i feel it
cover up rain down
we wept on the edge of this town

oh you look so alive
oh did you think wed cry
oh can you feel my heart
i think i feel it too
oh did you think wed die

and then we grabbed the sun
and it shined into these eyes
believe me

cover up rain down
we wept on the edge of this town
i feel it
cover up rain down
we wept on the edge of this town

take my love take it to the valley where the golden dove
flies it to the places where the silence screams
fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams

cover up rain down
we wept on the edge of this town
i feel it
cover up rain down
we wept on the edge of this town

when the days are cold and the cards all fold
and the saints we see are all made of gold
when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
are the worst of all and the bloods run stale

i want to hide the truth i want to shelter you
but with the beast inside theres nowhere we can hide
no matter what we breed we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come

when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide

at the curtains call its the last of all
when the lights fade out all the sinners crawl
so they dug your grave and the masquerade
will come calling out at the mess youve made

dont want to let you down but i am hellbound
though this is all for you dont want to hide the truth
no matter what we breed we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come

when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide

they say its what you make i say its up to fate
its woven in my soul i need to let you go
your eyes they shine so bright i want to save that light
i cant escape this now unless you show me how

when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide

ive tried to cut these corners
try to take the easy way out
i kept on falling short of something

i coulda gave up then but

ive traveled all this way for something

i take it in but dont look down

cause im on top of the world ay

we are all living the same way
we are escaping the same way
circling
we are a part of the same play
we think were making our own way
circling

you dont have to hold your head up high

round and round
i wont run away this time
till you show me what this life is for
round and round
im not gonna let you change my mind
till you show me what this life is for

we are afflicted by fiction
building a case for eviction
circling
guarding a tower of ancients
shooting down arrows of patience
and patiently circling

you dont have to hold your head up high

round and round
i wont run away this time
till you show me what this life is for
round and round
im not gonna let you change my mind
till you show me what this life is for

all the emptiness inside you
is hard enough to fill
without a sense of purpose
were setting up to fail
you dont have to make it right
just hold your head up high

round and round
i wont run away this time
till you show me what this life is for
round and round
im not gonna let you change my mind
till you show me what this life is for


so this is what you meant
when you said that you were spent
and now its time to build from the bottom of the pit
right to the top
dont hold back
packing my bags and giving the academy a raincheck

i dont ever want to let you down
i dont ever want to leave this town
cause after all

its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit
im just the same as i was
now dont you understand
that im never changing who i am

so this is where you fell
and i am left to sell
the path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
right to the top
dont look back
turning to rags and giving the commodities a raincheck

i dont ever want to let you down
i dont ever want to leave this town
cause after all

its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit
im just the same as i was
now dont you understand
that im never changing who i am

its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit
im just the same as i was

to ashes to ashes

its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit

that im never changing who i am

its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit

fog in the air
just to make my mind seem clear
where do i go from here
i see my breath pushing steam through the air
shaking hands run through my hair
my fears where do i go from here

is it my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other

walking down to the waters edge
asking why im here instead of home
now i stand alone
i stop to stare at the ocean side
im breathing in just to feel its side
with his
like you were here with me

is it my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other

its in the brightest light
its when the world is moving
oh its in the faintest cry
its in the lovers eye
is when i need you most
and dont you know

is it my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other

is it my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other

sink into the soil watch the water boil

they never look to see me fly so i never had to lie

i cant compare to nothing
ive ever known im hoping
that after this fever ill survive
i know im acting a bit crazy
strung out a little bit hazy
hand over heart im praying
that im gonna make it out alive

the beds getting cold and youre not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but im not alive until you call
and ill bet the odds against it all
save your advice cause i wont hear
you might be right but i dont care
theres a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

you got me scattered in pieces
shining like stars and screaming
lighting me up like venus
but then you disappear and make me wait
and every seconds like torture
heroin drip no more so
finding a way to let go

the beds getting cold and youre not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but im not alive until you call
and ill bet the odds against it all
save your advice cause i wont hear
you might be right but i dont care
theres a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

this is a modern fairytale
no happy endings
no wind in our sails
but i cant imagine a life without
breathless moments
breaking me down down down down

the beds getting cold and youre not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but im not alive until you call
and ill bet the odds against it all
save your advice cause i wont hear
you might be right but i dont care
theres a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

the heart wants what it wants baby

you were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
flashing those eyes like highway signs
light one up and hand it over rest your head upon my shoulder
i just wanna feel your lips against my skin

you told me this is right where it begins
but your lips hang heavy underneath me
and i promised myself i wouldnt let you complete me

im trying not to let it show that i dont want to let this go
is there somewhere you can meet me
cause i clutched your arms like stairway railings
and you clutched my brain and eased my ailing

youre writing lines about me romantic poetry
your girls got red in her cheeks cause were something she cant see
and i try to refrain but youre stuck in my brain
and all i do is cry and complain because seconds not the same

could we pretend that were in love

could we pretend that were in love


im searching for something that i cant reach

i dont like them innocent
i dont want no face fresh
want them wearing leather
begging let me be your taste test
i like the sad eyes bad guys
mouth full of white lies
kiss me in the corridor
but quick to tell me goodbye

you say that youre no good for me
cause im always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost whered you go
i cant find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost whered you go
what happened to the soul that you used to be

youre a rolling stone boy
never sleep alone boy
got a million numbers
and theyre filling up your phone boy
im off the deep end sleeping
saying that i love him but
i know im gonna leave him

you say that youre no good for me
cause im always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost whered you go
i cant find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost whered you go
what happened to the soul that you used to be

im searching for something that i cant reach

my ghost whered you go
i cant find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost whered you go
what happened to the soul that you used to be


theres a place way down in bed stuy
where a boy lives behind bricks
hes got an eye for girls of eighteen
and he turns them out like tricks

i went down to a place in bed stuy
a little liquor on my lips
i let him climb inside my body
and held him captive in my kiss

and theres a storm youre starting now
and theres a storm youre starting now
and theres a storm youre starting

im a wanderess
dont belong to no city
dont belong to no man
im the violence in the pouring rain
im a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
im a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
im a hurricane

i went down to a place in brooklyn
where you tripped on lsd
and i found myself reminded
to keep you far away from me

and theres a storm youre starting now
and theres a storm youre starting now
and theres a storm youre starting

im a wanderess
dont belong to no city
dont belong to no man
im the violence in the pouring rain
im a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
im a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
im a hurricane

he says oh baby beggin you to save me
well lately i like em crazy
oh maybe you could devastate me
little lady come and fade me

im a wanderess

dont belong to no man
im the violence in the pouring rain

come and fade me
come and fade me
im a hurricane


i i must confess
how hard i tried to breathe
through the trees of loneliness
and you you must confess
how hard you need to see
through the heart beating out my chest

feel like weve been falling down
like these autumn leaves
but baby dont let winter come
dont let our hearts freeze

if the morning light dont steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold

smoke as black as charcoal
fills into our fragile lungs
cause when our demons come
dancing in the shadows
to a game that cant be won

feel like weve been falling down
like these autumn leaves
but baby dont let winter come
dont let our hearts freeze

if the morning light dont steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold
if the morning light dont steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold

were the underdogs in this world alone
im a believer got a fever running through my bones
were the alley cats and they can throw their stones
they can break our hearts they wont take our souls

were the underdogs in this world alone
im a believer got a fever running through my bones
were the alley cats and they can throw their stones
they can break our hearts they wont take our souls

if the morning light dont steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold
if the morning light dont steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold
we will walk away from empty gold


would you bleed for me
lick it off my lips like you needed me
would you sit me on a couch
with your fingers in my mouth
you look so cool when youre reading me

lets cause a little trouble
oh you make me feel so weak
i bet you kiss your knuckles
right before they touch my cheek

but ive got my mind made up this time
cause theres a menace in my bed
can you see his silhouette
can you see his silhouette
can you see his silhouette

and ive got my mind made up this time
go on and light a cigarette set a fire in my head

would you lie for me
cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me
would you pin me to a wall
would you beg or would you crawl
stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me

lets cause a little trouble
oh you make me feel so weak
i bet you kiss your knuckles
right before they touch my cheek

but ive got my mind made up this time
cause theres a menace in my bed
can you see his silhouette
can you see his silhouette
can you see his silhouette

and ive got my mind made up this time
go on and light a cigarette set a fire in my head

dont forget me dont forget me
i wouldnt leave you if youd let me
hmm when you met me when you met me
you told me you were gonna get me

dont forget me dont forget me
i wouldnt leave you if youd

and ive got my mind made up this time
cause theres a menace in my bed
can you see his silhouette
can you see his silhouette
can you see his silhouette

and ive got my mind made up this time
go on and light a cigarette set a fire in my head


sick of all these people talking
sick of all this noise
tired of all these cameras flashing
sick of being poised
and now my neck is open wide
begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride
so theres no use crying about it

im headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and theres an old man sitting on the throne
thats saying that i probably shouldnt be so mean
im headed straight for the castle
theyve got this kingdom locked up
and theres an old man sitting on the throne
thats saying i should probably keep my pretty mouth shut

all of these people passing
saying that theyre feeling abused
if you wanna break these walls down
youre gonna get bruised
and now my neck is open wide
begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride
so theres no use crying about it

im headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen

my demons are begging me to open up my mouth
i need them mechanically make the words come out
they fight me vigorous and angry watch them pounce
ignite me licking up the flames they bring about

i sold my soul to a threepiece
and he told me i was holy
hes got me down on both knees
but its the devil thats tryna

hold me down hold me down
sneaking out the back door
make no sound
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for

hold me down hold me down
throw me in the deep end watch me drown
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for

selfish taking what i want and call it mine
im helpless clinging to a little bit of spine
they rush me telling me im running out of time
they shush me walking me across a fragile line

i sold my soul to a threepiece
and he told me i was holy
hes got me down on both knees
but its the devil thats tryna

hold me down hold me down
sneaking out the back door
make no sound
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for

hold me down hold me down
throw me in the deep end watch me drown
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for

hold me down now
hold me down now
hold me down

i sold my soul to a threepiece
and he told me i was holy
hes got me down on both knees
but its the devil thats tryna

hold me down hold me down
sneaking out the back door
make no sound
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for

hold me down hold me down
throw me in the deep end watch me drown
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for


cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles
just what youd expect inside her new balenciaga
vile romance turned dreams into an empire
selfmade success now she rolls with rockafellers

survival of the richest
the citys ours until the fall
theyre monaco and hamptons bound
but we dont feel like outsiders at all

we are the new americana
high on legal marijuana
raised on biggie and nirvana
we are the new americana

young james dean
some say he looks just like his father
but he could never love somebodys daughter
football team loved more than just the game
so he vowed to be his husband at the alter

high on legal marijuana
raised on biggie and nirvana

we know very well who we are
so we hold it down when summer starts
what kind of dough have you been spending
what kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately

my hands wrapped around your stick shift
swerving on the  i can never keep my eyes off this
my neck the feeling of your soft lips
illuminated in the light bouncing off the exit signs i missed

all we do is drive
all we do is think about the feelings that we hide
all we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
sick and full of pride
all we do is drive

and california never felt like home to me
and california never felt like home
and california never felt like home to me
until i had you on the open road and now were singing

your laugh echoes down the hallway
carves into my hollow chest spreads over the emptiness
its bliss
its so simple but we cant stay
over analyze again would it really kill you if we kissed

all we do is drive
all we do is think about the feelings that we hide
all we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
sick and full of pride
all we do is drive

and california never felt like home to me
and california never felt like home
and california never felt like home to me
until i had you on the open road and i was singing


cause i remember when my father put his fist through the wall that separated the dining room
and i remember the fear in your eyes the very first time we snuck into the city pool
late december with my heart in my chest and the clouds of my breath
didnt know where we were running to
but dont look back

well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
nut for now lets get away
on a roman holiday

could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to queens
cause i imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
and when it happens ill be miles away and a few months late
didnt know where i was running to
but i wont look back

well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
nut for now lets get away
on a roman holiday

feet first dont fall
well be running again
keep close stand tall

well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
nut for now lets get away
on a roman holiday


your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
you said your mother only smiled on her tv show
youre only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
i hope you make it to the day youre  years old

youre dripping like a saturated sunrise
youre spilling like an overflowing sink
youre ripped at every edge but youre a masterpiece
and now im tearing through the pages and the ink

everything is blue
his pills his hands his jeans
and now im covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and its blue
and its blue

everything is grey
his hair his smoke his dreams
and now hes so devoid of color
he dont know what it means
and hes blue
and hes blue

you were a vision in the morning when the light came through
i know ive only felt religion when im lying with you
you said youll never be forgiven til your boys are too
and im still waking every morning but its not with you

youre dripping like a saturated sunrise
youre spilling like an overflowing sink
youre ripped at every edge but youre a masterpiece
and im tearing through the pages and the ink

everything is blue
his pills his hands his jeans
and now im covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and its blue
and its blue

everything is grey
his hair his smoke his dreams
and now hes so devoid of color
he dont know what it means
and hes blue
and hes blue

everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue

you were red and you liked me cause i was blue
you touched me and suddenly i was a lilac sky
and you decided purple just wasnt for you

everything is blue
his pills his hands his jeans
and now im covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and its blue
and its blue

everything is grey
his hair his smoke his dreams
and now hes so devoid of color
he dont know what it means
and hes blue
and hes blue

everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue

when his hair falls in his face
and his hands so cold they shake

i found the devil
i found him in a lover
and his lips like tangerine
in his color coded speak

in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet

ive got a lover
and im unforgiving

its coming down down im coming down
its coming down down im coming down

and his head between my thighs

i found a savior

cause hes off to pay his crimes
and hes got no time for mine

in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet
we roll around beneath these sheets

i was as pure as a river
but now i think im possessed
you put a fever inside me
and ive been cold since you left
ive got a boyfriend now and hes made of gold
and youve got your own mistakes in a bed at home
im hoping you could save me now but you break and fold
youve got a fire inside but your hearts so cold

cause ive done some things that i cant speak
and ive tried to wash away but you just wont leave
so wont you take a breath and dive in deep
cause i came here so youd come for me

im begging you to keep on haunting
im begging you to keep on haunting me

we walk as tall as the skyline
and we have roots like the trees
but then your eyes start to wander
cause they werent looking at me

and ive tried to wash away but you just wont leave
so wont you take a breath and dive in deep
cause i came here so youd come for me

im begging you to keep on haunting

they send me away to find them a fortune
a chest filled with diamonds and gold
the house was awake
the shadows and monsters
the hallways they echoed and groaned

and i sat alone in bed till the morning
and crying theyre coming for me
and i tried to hold these secrets inside me
my minds like a deadly disease

im bigger than my body
im colder than this home
im meaner than my demons
im bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
please stop youre scaring me
i cant help this awful energy
goddamn right you should be scared of me
who is in control

i paced around for hours im empty
i jumped at the slightest of sounds
and i couldnt stand the person inside me
i turned all the mirrors around

im bigger than my body
im colder than this home
im meaner than my demons
im bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
please stop youre scaring me
i cant help this awful energy
goddamn right you should be scared of me
who is in control

with villains that live in my head
they beg me to write them
so theyll never die when im dead

he says oh baby girl you know were gonna be legends
im the king and youre the queen and we will stumble through heaven
if theres a light at the end its just the sun in your eyes

and ive been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
for a while now drowning my thoughts out the sounds

but do you feel like a young god
you know the two of us are just young gods
and well be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and theyre running running running

im searching for something that i cant reach

i dont like them innocent
i dont want no face fresh
want them wearing leather
begging let me be your taste test
i like the sad eyes bad guys
mouth full of white lies
kiss me in the corridor
but quick to tell me goodbye

you say that youre no good for me
cause im always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost whered you go
i cant find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost whered you go
what happened to the soul that you used to be

youre a rolling stone boy
never sleep alone boy
got a million numbers
and theyre filling up your phone boy
im off the deep end sleeping
saying that i love him but
i know im gonna leave him

you say that youre no good for me
cause im always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost whered you go
i cant find you in the body sleeping next to me

theres a place way down in bed stuy
where a boy lives behind bricks
hes got an eye for girls of eighteen
and he turns them out like tricks

i went down to a place in bed stuy
a little liquor on my lips
i let him climb inside my body
and held him captive in my kiss

and theres a storm youre starting now
and theres a storm youre starting now
and theres a storm youre starting

cause i remember when my father put his fist through the wall that separated the dining room
and i remember the fear in your eyes the very first time we snuck into the city pool
late december with my heart in my chest and the clouds of my breath
didnt know where we were running to
but dont look back

well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
nut for now lets get away
on a roman holiday

could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to queens
cause i imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
and when it happens ill be miles away and a few months late
didnt know where i was running to
but i wont look back

well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
nut for now lets get away
on a roman holiday

feet first dont fall
well be running again
keep close stand tall

well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
nut for now lets get away
on a roman holiday

two households both alike in dignity
in fair verona where we lay our scene
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny
where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of starcrossd lovers take their life
whose misadventured piteous overthrows
do with their death bury their parents strife
the fearful passage of their deathmarkd love
and the continuance of their parents rage
which but their childrens end nought could remove
is now the two hours traffic of our stage
the which if you with patient ears attend
what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend

i am a child of a
money hungry prideful country
grass is green and its always sunny
hands so bloody tastes like honey
im finding it hard to leave

im always street so ill forever be facin a change
and ill keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
and i demand respect from all if not then im waisten a man
and if i want it then i get and if i need it i have it
take care of them family first cause the liquir and weed is a habit
and im so often im congratulated for the succeeding at last
but when they turn they back i just have jesus leadin my path
and i didnt ask for you to like me i dont care if you hate me
but dont mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
and im faithfully inspired by the hood tell im gone
and dawg i do believe im grown
so ill be good on my own but i be like

thats not for me to decide thats for someone who decides to live with me to decide not for me

but are you willing to compromise within a relationship

to compromise what is compromising compromising for what compromising for what reason to compromise for what to compromise what is compromise

if a man came into your life wouldnt you want to compromise

i got ls on my record
weed on the vinyl
keys open doors when them keys is albino
now knock on my door when my stars is a lionel
ive been fishing for a minute for a minnow
only i know that a pawn is a trade
and a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
playing hooky for a tassel spend a minute on the minor
winds on my window
ash on my skin when the record low temps for the wind blow
only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
yar see
i crowd surf in a cypher
scuba in my shower take an uber to my neighbors
used to pay the piper till peter picked it better
now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
but memories keep coming back
wanna know how i used to was how i used to was

just wondering how we used to was how we used to was

young man tryna find the world in a broken hand


hey hey glory child hey

show me a better way i wish you could
show me a better way i wish you would
come home today you could

i am shooting stars you will never see me
watching over your every mistake
digging out of graves is never easy

just to see if its blue

sometimes i bite my lips and close my eyes
just to pretend its you
thats when i think of you
we were all thirteen once
long live tramp stamps and pepper ann
you will never judge me for that
you will always love me for that

warm winds on a space ride
i recall your soul and it taste like
gardens flowers warm winds

stationary birds await
small canary princess
young savage girl lost among the lily pads

sharpshooter in my backyard

keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky

making decisions shorty good things dont last long
your girlfriend keep showin me that thong
before i head home

wonder why i dont call her
maybe because im busy and she needs someone to spoil her
it gets annoying from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know well be friends and nothing more
she loves it when im in town
hate it when im not around
i get her and wear down
next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hittin the ground
just enough to hold us down
im stickin n moving cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a  year old feel like a young lady

i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call me by my government name
her panties wet over fame
fall in love with my chain
i wonder if i wasnt an entertainer would she remain
surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
im not your boyfriend im your homie

watching her lick her lips
i sweet talking her if she like
look im legit now used to break laws
now you can reap the benefit of world tours
big house big benz girl it yours
mink coats italian shoes stones with no flaws
you aint go to look like a model for me to adore you
all you gotta do is love me and be loyal
cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
come here let my touch on you i let you touch on me
put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me

for the 

ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxin cause they be actin maniac in action
a brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction
you looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
my rhyming skills got you climbing hills
i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants
twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue turn your system up
twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smog
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more cartoons than animation
my lamination of narration
when i declare invasion there aint no time to be staring gazing
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland
im infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
now im trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat im tempted to make another attempt at it
im infinite

bust it i let the beat commence so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies i spoil all your fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper then a jeep full of people
mcs are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one
imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator
theres never been a greater since the burial of jesus
my thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
my accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
that eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally
with entity dementedly meant to be infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
now im trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat im tempted to make another attempt at it
im infinite

man i got evidence im never dense and i been clever ever since
so im assuming all responsibility
cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill mcs
mic messaler slamming like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
no one is speacialer my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical
id rather let a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact i cant see or cant imagine
a man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
plus the man who never had a plan b
be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit
im tensed a bit and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit
im infinite

till im glad to be buried
and leave this crazy world
and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
it may be early to be planning this stuff
cause im still struggling hard to be the man and its tough
cause man its been rough but still i manage enough

im too stable to fall the pressure motivates
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
i seen the golden gates to heaven on earth
where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf q


im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps
everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheap
praying for sleep
dreaming with a watering mouth
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
in this slaughtering house caught up in bouts
with the root of all evil
ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
for these grants and jacksons
these transactions explain a mans actions
but in the mist of this insanity i found my christianity
through god and theres a wish he granted me
he showed me how to cope with the stress
and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
always groping a mess of flying over the nest
to selling dope with the rest
i quit smoking cess to open my chest
life is stressful inside this cesspool
trying to wrestle i almost bust a blood vessel
my little brothers trying to learn his mathematics
hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts
kids attract static children with automatics
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets
im using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
i wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
its cumbersome im trying to do well on this earth
but its been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth


uh its ok yeah its all right even though i cant sleep
uh yeah its ok its all right i cant sleep

the mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
still in my yard when i sculpted the culprit
then i buried the hatchet i carried the fat chick
butterfingers is here and its necessary to scratch it

ayo spiders are like tarantulas vandealous
living as scandalous as a television evangelist
but i can handle this im the rhyme biter crime fighter
caped crusader taking care of undeserving lime lighters
i think a living never meant for me
experimentally i found a way to spread interamentally
when i stumbled upon this resolution
by using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
you couldnt see me with binoculars
i armed like an octopus
step on stage and you get socked and pushed
talking that junk like you went black guarded your back
come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
when i rap i represent it and will never referee in it
every minute so when i win it you never resent it
im forever demented come up with funk ill never be scented
you got the point when i cleverly said it


we dont wanna fight we dont want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyones feeling all right
we dont wanna fight we dont want no one feeling uptight

and treat you like a piece
of plywood
ive got miracle lyrical capability all in me
with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous
i rap for all you draculas and showed you all how whack you was
i meant it as a dis cause you dont posses the pizzazz as this
im hazardous enough already as it is
without you adding fuel to the fire
im cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign of hell rule to the sire
clinical studies show that im cynical
theres no one whos identical to my fresh and authentic flow
im sure the party people can agree
that im enchanting with the romantic
freaking the vocals so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here just be like


we dont wanna fight we dont want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyones feeling all right
we dont wanna fight we dont want no one feeling uptight

i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine
she tests positive but tells you that her acts clean
plus she got a sugar daddy
asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
if you mistook her sadly on her reputation
youre in jepordation if you aint got no preparation
when you step away son she got her face done
looking provocative shell let you knock it if
you press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price otherwise she wont look at you twice
but when you catch the lice or get the urgency
to go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
dont bring your germs to me cause i aint trying to hear it

sometimes i wonder whats your purpose in life that is
you say its gonna stop but it just slows down
and then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this
mystery whatever your reason even is to be
you say you wanna be with me but how can you say that
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

i met this girl last week she was a freak and she liked me
so i stepped on it and then asked my homies
big game over there and take notes while i get this number
turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
and said oh its like that
she said her name was maxine so i told her i wanted her number
she asked could i give her mine two
got to the crib and called her up
i said maxine check this out
give me your address ill be through and youll find out
got to the crib she let me in
she didnt waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
i said hold up and stop proceeding you rushing things
so i went for my protection took off my clothes and started flexing
as she went for my midsection
i threw her down as i tore off her shirt
pulled out my jimmy and i thought about putting in work
before i hit it she said
 dont get mad but theres something that i gotta tell your ass
she said no i forgot to tell you that i got aids
i got up out

its an amazing task to battle with success
and in a slug fest i get physical like physicians
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry like a sorcerer no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
so feel the force of my spiritual images
slicing up an enemys appendages till he hemorrhages
my skin itches every time a rapper recites
and when hes through with his verse im all covered in flea bites
you wanna see fights i got a match for you

point him out man i wanna know

you wanna feel the full effect of me hand a tech to me
intellectually superior ill make the whack wearier
inferior deteriorate like bacteria
materially killing serially clearly youll see
how much in fear when you hear me youll be and
shiver and shake quiver and quake
bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache wither and break
you slithering snake gibbering fake fibbering flake
ill twist you into a different shape
and toss you in michigan lake for fishermens sake
if this is a dream youd wish you can wake
every diss you can take personal

missing what i remember kissing and hugging and squeezing
bugging and weezing im having trouble when breathing
its even tougher when sleeping

for loving and leaving youre all im thinking of in the evening
you got my knees buckling and weakening
thoughts of nothing but freaking that im struggling to keep in
and interrupt when im speaking
i got some game that im preparing to run
the way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun no matter what youre wearing you stun
cause your comparing to none i wanna share in the fun
i feel a passionate lust when im imagining just us alone at last with a
touch
i see you grasping to trust but my intentions are good
the seed is passing in dust
im not asking to rush and answer me immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
cause i just need you to see how much im eager to be
your man legally wed your loves keeping me fed
this is easily said so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down cause aint nobody like you no where to be found


baby its all on you its you i call on boo
lets set a day up so you can fall on through
well take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
well start it out with caviar don parigne
and then when its a fact we are warm carry on
well take it slow see nobody will hurry things
i got the herbs the bacardi and hurricane
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
its still all right cause i got minute maid and tangeray
your an incredible one thats rare in bed with edible underwear
you look impeccable nothing compares
i dream of freaking you the women that will speak it too so
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
now we all set to play only thing left to say is
when you step away baby but dont forget the neglicie

locking down every block and put up metal detectors

i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta

stay away from him he aint no good

i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
sneezing at dust and swinging at the spiderwebs
inside the depths of his basement
i taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
none of my guys knew where im at i was doomed
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume

i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no good

dealing with backstabbers there was one thing i learned
theyre only powerful when you got your back turned
i yearned for the day that we finally met again
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine
he shed his skin then he promised to come clean
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
beating him over the head with the telephone

attention all cars attention all cars

it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only squabble only irrelevant issues
too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings you say im bad at timing things
so whats a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
i used to love your company now you always bugging me
for information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
so ima wait for your evacuation
cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see ive never been so sure and your just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check them in
look at the nervous wreck im in i need my second wind say what


me and eminem dont need nothing but my and his money
jealous of me know what im saying thats what im talking about

i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
i used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
until the day i started following your feetprints
and tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
it made complete sense theres someone else you like
so i confronted you and asked you who was mike
someone rich that i could follow
and youll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
leaving me in sorrow brandy never felt so broken hearted
i fell apart when you departed then the joking started
i was an open target you play comedian
and i became the laughing stock but now im on my feet again
and so we meet again your acting like an exwife
all in my sex life i got a message from phife
he goes you didnt want me to see you then i dont want you now
take a towel wipe your brow quit trying to hunt me down
you run me down and now your trying to apologize
for all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size you wanna swing it
jealousy is in the house yall fellas sing it



eminem

no

eminem

no


what do you want from me

remember me

i killed you

you thought i was dead didnt you

what do you want from me

im alive

oh my god

get up

no

get up and look in the mirror

i dont want to

look in the mirror to see your reflection

leave me alone

look in the mirror  youre nothing youre nothing without me



you see this bullet hole in my neck its self inflicted
arrested molested myself and got convicted
wearing visors sunglasses and disguises
cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
im dr hyde and mr jekyl
disrespectful
hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
murder murder redrum
brain size of a bread crumb
which drug will i end up dead from
inebriated till my stress is eleviated
use to let the babysitter suck my dick when i was littleer
sniper waiting on your roof like the fiddler
yall thought i was gonna rhyme with riddler

im low down and im shiftee
and if you hear a man that sounds like me smackem

i lace tunes im out this world like space moons
with a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
doing whippits passed out like sanford snippits
wheres the weed i wanna tamper with it
ima let your grandpa hit it
mix it up with cocaine so her cant forget it
but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what im on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
losing all of my leverage
went up inside the first national bank broke and left rich
walking biohazard causing wreckage
smoked out like
band just making my neck itch
you just lost your tip theres a pubic hair in my breakfast
get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mamas chapped lips
slap hips support domestic violence
im just joking is dirty dozens really dust smoking

my heads ringing like it was spider sense tingling
im out the game put the second string in
this brandy got my swinging
bobbing back and forth like a penguin
delinquent toking microphones with broken english
make your mama be like oh this is good who sing this
slim shady his tape is dope i love it
it was predicted by a medic
id grow to be an addicted diabetic
living off liquid triametic
pathetic but i dont think this headaches ever vanishing
panicing i think i might have just took too much anasin
frozen manaquin posted stiffer than a statue
i think im dying god is that you
somebody help me before i od on an lp
take me to er asap for and iv
they say thats where it ends the closest they gon come is tupac
its politics its all a fix
setup by these white blue collared hicks
just to make a dollar off of black music
with a subliminal ball of tricks
but those can kiss ass and swallow dicks


life by marshall mathers
what is life
life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down and every time you think you gotten past it its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends
friends are people that you think are your friends but they really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin
what is money
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
moneyll make them same friends come back around swearing that they was always down
what is life
im tired of life

im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
im tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and minithins
tired of not having a deal
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo

if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have one on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasnt feeling me on nobodys as ill as me
im tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of jlb saying where hiphop lives

murder murder murder and kill kill kill

all i see is murder murder my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder my mind state
murder murder murder and kill kill kill

left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
and for what your lifes worth this money is twice that
grab a couple grand and layup in iceland
see im a nice man but money turned me to satan
im thirsty for this green so bad im dehydratin
shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
i want the whole pie i wont be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description an sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
but i aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cause i got a daughter to feed
and  aint enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell an hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasnt nuttin for her to be smoked
then i slammed her on her back till her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin freeze
but im already wanted for sellin kis
and a bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots they bust back
hit me square in the chest i wasnt wearin a vest

all i see is murder murder my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder my mind state
murder murder murder and kill kill kill

all i see is murder murder my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder my mind state
murder murder murder and kill kill kill

left the house pullin out the drive backin out
pulled the mac out and stuck it in her face
shut ya yackin mouth before i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair smacked her up
stole her car made a profit
grabbed a tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl on set it off did
jetted off kid stole the whip now im a criminal
drove it through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but im injured badly though
parents screamin johnny go in and call the police
tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo 
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an year old lady with groceries
there goes the cheese eggs milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped must o been some dumbluck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i must o dropped the beanie baby
surrendered my weapon to cops
wasnt me it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint schnopps

all i see is murder murder my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder my mind state
murder murder murder and kill kill kill

all i see is murder murder my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder my mind state

a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny lookin white boy scrawny and always ornery
cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
and i might snap one day just like that
i decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
my first day in junior high this kid said
its you and i three oclock sharp this afternoon you die
he said dont try to run from me youll just make it worse
my palms were sweaty and i started to shake at first
something told me try to fake a stomach ache it works
i screamed ow my appendix feels like they could burst
teacher teacher quick i need a naked nurse
oh i mean it is but i also got a bum knee
and just for that stunt youre gonna get some extra homework

they say i never knew which way i was goin
but everywhere i go they keep playin my song

brain damage ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on

but everywhere i go they keep playin my song
brain damage

way before my baby daughter hailey
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named dangelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes
so everyday hed shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him we shouldnt beef
but he just wouldnt leave he kept chokin me and i couldnt breathe
he looked at me and said you gonna die honkey
and started helpin him stomp me
i made them think they beat me to death
holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitors storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
im gettin you back bully now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it till i broke the wood
knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot
made it home later that same day
started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldnt even see what i was tryna to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin what are you on drugs
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

brain damage ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin
but everywhere i go they keep playin my song

brain damage ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on

but everywhere i go they keep playin my song

its brain damage

its probably brain damage

life by marshall mathers
what is life
life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down and every time you think you gotten past it its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends
friends are people that you think are your friends but they really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin
what is money
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
moneyll make them same friends come back around swearing that they was always down
what is life
im tired of life

im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
im tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and minithins
tired of not having a deal
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wonders why im smartin off
im tired of being fired every time i fart and cough
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
im tired of using plastic silverware
tired of working in building square tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
id make the world suck my dick without a condom on while im on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough cause id still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have one on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasnt feeling me on nobodys as ill as me
im tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of jlb saying where hiphop lives

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
id make the world suck my dick without a condom on while im on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough cause id still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

you know what im saying

it is the most disgusting thing i have ever heard
in my entire life and i seriously want to call his
it like makes me upset i am now nauseous and i cant eat lunch
goodbye


ok im going to attempt to drown myself
you can try this at home
you can be just like me
mic check   we recordin

im cancerous
so when i diss you wouldnt wanna answer this
if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for canibus
ill strangle you to death then ill choke you again
take you on jerry springer and beat your ass legally
i get too blunted off of funny home grown
so if i said i never did drugs
hillary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
my nerves hurt and lately im on edge
every girl i ever went out with is goin les
smoke weed take pills drop outta school kill people and drink
jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
im dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
so im dumb enough to ask a for date with lauryn hill
some people only see that im white ignoring skill
cause i stand out like a green hat with an orange bill
but i dont get pissed yall dont even see through the mist
i get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger wont go down how do i wave
and this is how im supposed to teach kids how to behave

now follow me and do exactly what you see
dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
i slap women and eat shrooms then od
now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me

me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
my mind wont work
if my spine dont jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
im not a player just an ill rhymesayer
my rap styles warped
im runnin out the morgue
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn
with an acorn
im about as normal as norman bates
with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there i love you
will someone please explain
to my brain
that i just severed a main vein
with a chainsaw and im in pain
i take a breather and sigh either im high
or im nuts cause if you aint tiltin this room neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer
shoved in her ass then it probably is obvious i got it on with her
i bought cages tape opened it and dubbed over it

i came to the club drunk and with a fake id
dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
ive been with  women who got hiv
now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
i got genital warts and it burns when i pee
dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
i tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
you probably wanna grow up the just like me


ill tell you what i dont believe in can i do that
all right i dont believe in the in laws or the system by any means whatsoever
i try not to obey them at any time
thats what i believe in not believing in
four big bottles of water a day two packs of marlboro reds and
music i have to listen to music all day long
i say that keeps me going
im a pretty dark person ive thought about ending it a million times
and i have to say that music keeps me here by far the main thing

thank you
sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now freestyle or write down whatever
and still i come up clever i just need to free my thoughts
and lord knows that i know better but i aint perfect
i aint seen too many churches or know them testament verses
you should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead die trying and know death
might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath
i mean that from the bottom of my heart
you see my art is all i have and victory tastes sweet
even when the enemy can throw salt
let bygones be bygones but where im from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
my uncle doing life inside prison he wasnt wrapped too tight
thats why im shaking my head when you rap dissing
my stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching
i start evaluating then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up would just come up
and this is compton lions in the land of the triumph
wrap saran our defiance ban our alliance
put burners in the hands of the black man
one hood with twenty fofos like a cloned kobe bryant
you probably heard i wanna be heard and wonder who i am
you probably even listen to faith and think i know zion
but really im just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like its always clashing with science
i got a big fear of flying
my future so bright id probably go blind before i blink twice i aint lying
i swear to god half of yall just dont know kendrick
the school of hard knocks we was the first ones in attendance
you walking down the block he got shot you wouldnt know i witnessed
you just mind your bidness
you just turn your head kneel down and then tie your tennises
its kinda scary aint it
just let me explain this why you pick up that stainless
cause your pops wasnt anxious to see you when you hated him
so much you probably had your burner tucked in graduation
said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him facing
twentyfive to life with a murder charge
your enemies was the prey and now you pray to god
i pray these bars get farther than compton
and if my record never break i still wont break my promise i promise to keep it honest
secret society all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come
and im like the kendrick lamar od in less than a month
all right gotta keep it pushing
cant let the government tell me how my future looking
im on rosecrans and central trying to duck the central bookings
ive been a warrior when i came out of my moms placenta
in the gutter lane like im master splinter
how splendid i guess my project had did it
they said seven tracks i said fifteen
called it an ep they said im tripping
but little did they know im tryna change the rules
that weve been confined to so the corporate wont make decisions
killing our dreams stealing our vision
out in haiti adolescents barely have a home
who we hanging with and bragging about the iphone
i swear to god most yall cats just dont know kendrick
you barely know yourself so i guess most of yall should be offended
aint doing this for my health im just trying to purchase my momma them businesses
occupy my time with riches justify my time ambitions
just to coincide just to go inside books we idolize while we living
look the mastermind took the masters mind just the perfect time just to mastermind

we would like to call this an appreciation tape
for those who recognized the kendrick lamar ep
for this is the kendrick lamar od
because of you we are overly dedicated


where are we going why are we slowing down
where are you going we should be growing now


thats what she said to me
that place i used to call home is just a bed to me
and we dont even sleep neighbors can hear her weep
meanwhile im in these streets with everybody
im trying to get it and she know they got me i watch her feelings watch me
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
look each other in the face and barely blink
i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
so if my letters dont reach you i hope these lyrics in sync

thats what it said to me
but that place i call ambition now dead to me
gone and forgotten im off track like dale earnhardt
my liver rotten alcoholic tripping
balling out but im bout to drop the ball
im calling out for help my engineer called
told me come to the studio i wanna tell him nah

thats what he said to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me
only a hundred and fortyfour can go
seven billion people on planet earth today
is there something that i dont know
i know to follow him rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means im following evil
guess im following evil i should follow cathedral
blessings i need but live like i dont need you

so in conclusion
we all seem to stumble planning our own demise
forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
so to whats important in my life i apologize
i promise to stay faithful focused and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards
would you not know how to act or take action its just a part of life

im trying to visualize how to get it right
but my visions so blurry
trying to slow it down stay close to the ground
but were always in a hurry now
and if i could make this world stand a little slower
then i would then we could grow a little closer
i think were getting closer
i think were getting closer


i remember uh
all my uncles sir smokers
on the landra in front of our building
they was my heroes


uh and thats scary to me
dope beat dope flow vary to me
especially when sounwave is on his ps
dont fast forward ima serve you some keys
this is crack cocaine im kurt cobain
and i bang like a crip
priu high you im an iv
i said an iv cause when i be
in the studio high shot a needle in your vein
take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
im cold on the cold turkey i hate chickens
over the pyrex where my world at

uh and thats scary to me
every listener is a strawberry to me
disease on kdot uh uh better wake up
curl up like big worm when i drop
who fly im a red eye with eyedrops
i big i pac you chris i rock
thats pookie hom new jack headfirst with a cyclops
im the first one to do that i bet you never knew that
back like a tailbone who you got to tell on
if it aint about me about hoe
or be about face if you aint no higher learn it
theres soda in the pot and the fire burning

uh and its scary to carry
a smoothtype flow like a drink of merlot
thatll freak yall out like a girl virgo
when i turbo on any track its a reynolds wrap
you could fall to defeat if you dont pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet i suppose
this is bigger than life
this is probably everybody illuminatis
guess im the blood sacrifice
of the party i undress her like a harley
lights will flash cars will crash
smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
so my bad if i put you in rehab
you are reimbursed put it on my tab



gina baby i dont have no money and i dont have no ends
im going through something right now
i told you that

oh what up hoe oh what up
i said oh what up hoe oh what up
i said oh what up hoe oh what up
well all right

welcome to my diary stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me rather than societys
woes let me go let me shine a lil bit love
i want diamonds too ronnie on players club
i used to have a ninetofive fresh out of school that was 
pushing in my mama van stop for gas on rosecrans
pain since my grandmas death uncle killed at louies burgers
hold my tears i tried my best let it go trench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the marginmargin
maintaining my modestmodest as i dream

how was your day

mhmm

coming down clean tell your baby mama what it do

when you let me when you let me

give me that funk that sweet that nasty
i cant get enough
if i offend you blame it on the liquor babe
give me that funk that sweet that nasty
i cant get enough
if i offend you

uh i wrote this song when dave drove home
and it made me think when another car blinked
to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the everhard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain problem and sorrow
your car now due and you bout to get evicted
but still you proceed to dive deep ask whats her zodiac sign

okay welcome to my diary hmm where should i begin
finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
crackers watch my every step man i hate to work for them
and here i am stressing questioning my direction man
what to do nothings moving traffic jam wiggle through it
soul balls deep ya dig
retrieve relief ya dig
lets kill a bottle of tequila
and lie buttnaked telling the truth would ya
take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
cause all ive been thinking the whole day

give me that wont you give that once again its on
coming down clean tell your baby mama what it do
where your friends at i got long dick what it is
go on poke it out situate your little positives
how i live big shot on my grind all ready
ima lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
when you let me when you let me


she look better than beyonce alicia keys halle berry miss jolie
wheres she from no id that girls an alien
and if i die before i wake i pray that im in outer space
ufo fly away
so lets gogogogo lets gogogogo
lets gogogogo lets go lets go

uh she got me going im all in
fifty stories im falling
where you been is it planet mars
far beyond the stars are you a martian
youre unfamiliar but still i feel ya
energy is sending me toward the ceiling
im high now are you up there
if you was i would climb every other stair
i gotta stare i mean wow
and im wowed no one compares
a oneonone you must have won
every pageant in america when you was young
lips hips hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy insane crazy
the only girl that can make time then make me stop

uh so now we on so now we gone
living in the city of the unknown
i show her off i stunt with her
we do it sweet they look bitter
look at her get up i hear em say
but why him i hear em hate
i laugh at it rather than jab at it
then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause im addicted and you the drug
cold turkey no sir
gotta be an odyssey from heaven way above
you definite not probably i gotta give it up
lips hips hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy insane crazy
the only girl that can make time then make me stop

you something different
im glad i found you
so pretty
ill never do anything to hurt you



uh
we hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people
im inspired so get inspired

and so he said why you gotta be so kindhearted
why you couldnt be a conartist why you couldnt
why you couldnt be mischievous or just a lil devious
the moment that we first started
why you never ask for nothing just a lil time
why you let me use yours cause i dont got mines
why you always lift me up when im completely giving up
why you giving me your last knowing you aint got it
why you always buy me something when you going shopping
why you tell me that you love me why you always thinking of me
want my company rather than going club hopping
why you treating my momma like she your momma too
why you making promises that youll forever do
whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family
these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you sometimes

we hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
nothing in common it aint fair
but where do we seem to fall
where do we seem to fall
tender love and care once upon a time
once upon a time we was there

and so she said why you gotta be so mean to me
why you dont know what you mean to me
why you always playing games why i feel like you ashamed
out in public curse me out and make a scenery
why text messages popping up saying hi daddy
why you treat me like im nothing why you always at a function
i be wanting to go out but you dont never ask me
why you slip and say her name when we having sex
why you always assuming that i still love my ex
every time we get into it im the one thats feeling stupid
you dont need me you gon leave me thats your favorite threat
why you never know how it feel to be lonely
why i feel im the last option after your homies
why you always gotta know that i will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me sometimes

she says she loves me she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when i want to be left alone
but shes beautiful
like sometimes when i have things on my mind shes the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice she says when i give her a cue
she says she loves me
like when i wake up in the morning
shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me
she says she needs me she says she loves me
or like when im stepping out of the shower
shes standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off
she says she says she loves me
so instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says she says she loves me
and i dont know about love


i used to want to be like michael jordan
figured i would hit the nba and make me a fortune

used to clean my rollie chain with alcohol in the sink

you see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in compton

proves that ignorance is bliss

this my world i grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these california earthquakes hit so hard

rappers need to go call
ghostbusters to shoot busters im casper when i go off
i show up to show out to show off

and if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
i remember being  wishing someone would sign me
now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
backin down boggins
we gon flip her once she off that blue dolphin
you gon tip her
cause ignorance is bliss
and willy b im a fool on yo beats i bleed out the speaker
as the speaker that spoke when they done speak



like should i start trapping if what i write down
dont connect this very moment then im on it no question
do i cop a pound of kush promethazine or push some e
oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when i sleep
this is deep as the abyss im not just rhyming on the beat
i be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
this is me frustrated battling my own evils
finna saddle up that work across ohio in a geo
or should i sell my music zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo track record of a hustler
rather records on the needle making music
clocking fast bank like a shot from patrick ewing
im tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting

reporting live compton california

have you ever felt like like you never get life
like you never get right sort of like a black sheep
back down backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
i struck enough pain let her know i wasnt playing
and back theyd tell me its very difficult to see twentyfive
and if i survive i probably wouldnt sell it
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto rather in some heals like giuseppes
they want me unemployed until i hit the streets
for filling voids of broke dboys selling weed
bb king or the neighbors of snoop

they say its only one life life life
and if you say i cant live comfortable
ima tell you thats a lie lie lie
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past

celebrate the very day that i get past

have you ever felt like like you never get life
like you never did right sort of like a black sheep
tryna get away from the world stereotype
barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
she desperately in need of some inspiration see what the people saying

she will never get by no how no way
welfare recipient property of the state
housing section  corner store prostitute
hoodrat trashy six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
chilling in pajamies waiting on the first
fastforward spilling drinks on her fur

cause i wont get caught again
and im here to start the trend
you cant catch me if you try

so you made it past all the barbed wires


the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you to know me within sixteen bars
thats the hardest thing

on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary relatives in high school
with that being said each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head i needed survival
got jumped got jacked shot at shot back
and i dont even push a line im just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said youre judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider that if it goes down
so if you ask what im doing
im tryna duck the influence of my city thats blueand real talk and

but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up and i was like hold up
where you from howbang
where you stay westside thats a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the culdesac
shots rang out hoping to god i wasnt wet
crossed to cross rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the hot ninetyfive they said they already knew
what happened and meet em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
grabbed the nineball opened up the door then got in
you my brother like a frat and thats just to remind you

but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

i dont do black music i dont do white music
i do everyday life music
you say you through but ive been through it now thats cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps no powersteering
i use perseverance in this mad city
bernie mac died its no joke
dont ask why if you dont know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed you smoke that but im high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause its hotter than a lunatics underarms in a straitjacket
in other words we get it cracking but i keep it cool yknow

but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

so there you have it
but im a leave you with this
an og once told me
a real gangster is either dead or in jail
or behind the scenes getting real money
im gone


hoc hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc
hoc hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc
hoc

especially when drop drop the beat
i drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
jump in the booth then shatter every rappers dream
they jump in a sauna because i killed their selfesteem
thats a jab you should bob and weave
like pam when martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
i go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
you telling me the kush make you think on level four
im on five you saying i can level more
in high school my teachers thought i was smoking stress
didnt know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
i stimulate my mind every time i think about the end of time
creation of man and columbine

probably think im off the kush or the hydro
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your endo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke

look nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from wiz khalifa
knowing damn well they cant hit the sour
they new booties they probably need baby powder
my skill shower over your city for forty days
before you get it twisted like forty gays
my flow worth the earth thats not to be appraised
those the type of lines that im talking bout
you know the type of rhymes you dont talk about
copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
brag on me like my sons bout to win
somehow someday and i dont care when
i might hit the gin once a month
ill let you inhalein hell like an atheist

uh ill take you back to the ninth grade
when dough boy had me high for four days
but anyway i think it was some purple
told me dont hit it hard because itll hurt you
i didnt listen i was floating like the rose parade
that was the vegas trip hooters sponsored
just underline every letter
capital kdot letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks and what you bout
nothing huh am i square cause i dont puff a square
are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt yeah

hoc hoc

im tryna find myself im searching deep for kendrick lamar
i read about napoleon hill and try to know god
they say he the key to my blessings
and if i speak the good into existence that instant my dreams will unlock
money flow like water ill just wait at the dock
and by the way ima start finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
im back chilling with a friend of mine she mighty fine
but i notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
always hollering who she dont like and who she kick it with
who she wanna fight who wearing a weave
who dooney and bourke bag is fake who holding the keys
and who need a pap smear getting on my nerves

cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoopdewhoop blaseblah
he say she say oh my god
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoopdewhoop blaseblah
he say she say

or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it take just to reach the top
im talking ideas motivation
oh thats not your memo then tell me why you constant stressing
i function with you and you flaunt your pistol
every second tell me how you pressed him at the monte crystal
where soandso from and what neighborhoods beefing
who baby mommas a rat and who got killed last weekend

cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoopdewhoop blaseblah
he say she say oh my god
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoopdewhoop blaseblah
he say she say

uh im tryna learn something new

im tryna feel the vibe of mona lisa studying art
now paint that picture life behind bars
remember the very day i got caught
i murdered a rapper and you filed the police report
see what i was taught family is all i need
but indeed them too can run me right up a tree
wanting me to take sides but id never give in
ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
argue on holidays left my uncle in prison
for fifteen years no one paid him attention but moms
yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
come to my house just to yap about your own people dang
and if your blood wasnt running through my veins
i would probably cut yall off too yep

hiiipower is the way we think the way we live
see its known today that the human race is nothing
no moral no standards
what were about to do is raise the level of expectations
no you dont have to have a lot of money
you dont have to be rich
but you will be rich in mind and spirit
some say its as big as a crew some say its as big as a gang
hiiipower we stand for it as if its as big as a religion



bullets flying helicopters police sirens preachers lying
genosism criticism unemployment racism
burning buildings aids victims cancer killing no cure
oil spilling turmoil povertystricken
police brutality kicking ass of us africans hostages in afghanistan

i used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalized
my intuition has said i was suited for family ties
my momma is stressing my daddy tired
every minute hour and second ministers tried to save me
how im gonna listen when i dont even hear god
heaven or hell base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty you worried bout mud in your sink
i deal with ya like my son stare at the sun
and youll be looking in my eyes homie
stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
uncles twentythree hours sending me pictures
i want you to know that im so determined to blow
that you hear the music i wrote hope it get you off death row
you came home to a pocket full of stones
a metro pc phone then you went back in
so when i touch the pen the pen is in my view
imma get it right just so you

see a block away from lueders park i seen the el camino parked
in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
her anatomy is gods temple
and its quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
shes always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
remember the sergeant let her slide said if he seen
whats between her thighs hed compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized shell never escape the allure
of a black man white man needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice but now shes numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners redemption
that sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and thats when he touched her
block away from lueders park i seen the el camino park
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters still she hit the back seat

my little sister eleven i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song set her down and pressed play

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars oh
fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars


alright here we go third take
real quick ali

and this is rigamortus and its gorgeous when you die
ali recorded and im morpheus the matrix of my mind
im out the orbit you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
i climax where you begin and then i end on cloud nine
and thats important when you morph into a angel in the sky
and dont be forging all my signatures my listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style you got a hell of an appetite
and imma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight we always making em duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
aim it at your celebrity this is studio felony
ferragami so many and cool enough for the seventies
dead em all and especially leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say that he rest in peace bigger chopper the recipe
wrestling thats irrelevant rather rest at your residence
whistling to the melody couldnt think of a better d
better be on your p and q its just me jay rock soul and q
solar system and barbecue nothing else you can do


got me breathing with dragons
ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
im marilyn manson dont ask for your favorite rapper


got me breathing with dragons
ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
im marilyn manson dont ask for your favorite rapper

i rapped him and made him casper i captured the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya i pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners wont you send us to bible study faster
your hypocriteesque reaction a blasphemy i assassin my casualty
and its casually done and tell em my salary come
a lump sum of hundreds dont talk to me bout no money
the sun is under my feet and i come in peace to compete
i dont run if you rather leap my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek and i get busy on many mc really ballistic
anybody can see any assistance everybody done see some persistence
recognize i be really too vicious the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets better partition better dot your t
and i gon mention how the far you see putting my dick in the rap industry
and im charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity


got me breathing with dragons
ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
im marilyn manson dont ask for your favorite rapper

how far is heaven lets see
is it in the clouds like they said it would be
i wonder when i die will he give me receipts

my plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
im dying inside i wonder if zion inside the heavens
a condom a rollie pain a fat blunt and a mac
thats all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinners advice
when i lie on back and look at the ceiling its so appealing to pray
i wonder if im just a villain dealing my morals away
some people look at my face then tell me dont worry bout it
i give em back they deposit no money just total silence
im running they say im wilding a youngn with lack of guidance
thats hundreds of us with problems more money more drugs and violence
look at the soul of an outofcontrol artist
thats dealing with life the hardest thats on my life but regardless imma

ride to it ride to it cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it die to it
die to it die to it live your life live it right

yeah life can please ya but death can tease ya
on the day niko had that seizure i lost one of my biggest believers
close deaths make you think about your life
like if i had that same chance twice what would i do different
id tell her i loved her more do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
now when im done recording swear i let the beat bang in her name
make her shake her head in heaven saying they at it again
make them clouds turn to speakers dont take too much smoke
from the reefer love being in the room with her peoples
now my love life murking it family having surgeries

and treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
im hopin that aint nobody else as special as you
when i say ive been disappointed im addressin a few
i finesse then i groove
while most of the  to s in my past
now get a rating thats less than a 
its true i been talking to aleshia keisha and nadia
and shadia had to throw peace signs to a lot of yas

a girl i can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
yeah my name aint change but im far from the man that i used to be
since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
and groupies are gettin brave
rappers i write em a verse
and ask me to spit it
but i pay no mind though
cause they know i know
they wont sign so
drake and vo back
i take it you know that
you take it sitting down
or you can take it to gold black
and since drake done took it from curls to waves
its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
i mean i had my share of women
with most of em its seemin like they world is staged
but from georgia to bk and all around the world
get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
if youve been hurt and you alone be steady
these the same dudes from rewind grown and ready and uh

look theres requirements to be an admirer
still the new version of fresh needa a nia or tyra
so we can be jenny and swayze
i told you im careful with my heart girl many have played me
or maybe its karma
they say is a charmer
im fire on the move
a tire looking smooth
im not perfect but i got a desire to improve
im special
like kids in a graduating class
having more trouble than others when addin basic math
need you to be special like areba to cootmore
double o top secret agents with suits on
something so deep it da drown me
friends are some cool dudes
i vouch for the people around me
on your end its simple
all you have to do
is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh

you cant just love me like they do
i need someone special in you
i know that out there theres a few
see ive been searching i dont what to do
can you help me

southern smoke echo
its southern smoke baby
put ya hands in the air

nowadays you sayin that i should go jermaine i should go pharrell
so you could get checks cut like benedict in oceans twelve
this aint brad pitt i gotta admit
they say my father lives through me so this is just basically how my dad spit
i know my cash come quick when its sunny
you know a girl is special if i stick with her honey
if it wasnt for dummies chick would still have money
and if it wasnt for money nick would still have skummy

so guess its kinda like a gift and a curse
to jip money is easier than liftin a purse

its always the same eh
always complainin
its obvious baby
i guess you dont watch the news
you see theres a lot to lose
cause we got a baby
and people are shady

my generation is changin
aside from the fact
the dealers have customers they provide with the crack
front of the buses taken
and we denied from the back
you can die where from or die where you at

dont put it past them
i dont think that they understood
my friends they dont even sit in the class when they should
he can come pick you up
if your dads in the hood

lately i dont know about the friends that i hang with
im nervous round my boys it depends on their anguish
depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
with dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
depends on what they do to achieve that
robbing rampb singers specially if they know where the keys at

they using this darkness for penetration in the hood
i took the ivory way in and yes im glad that keenan could

loves lost
loves gone
love lost

look
in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
rappers they tend to be smilin
because they swimmin in women
most of em sick of favors
they come in secret flavors
thats why i envy omar
because so far

and thats some higher learning
trying ta excel with the brake on
ill have you stuck in the same spot
with the tires burnin
and im a liar turnin  jaded with no faith
in any female thats askin what i was earnin
i met this recent lady
she knew a piece of sadey by spinners
i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
cause she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me
its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
now im out of both and ive been thinkin of aleshia lately
im all alone i got a feelin its on
cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh

loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
circling workplaces
and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
they get to first bases
then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin
he wanna know what the first trace is
now you like macgyver
cause you sneakin around
and she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her
i cant relate to that
i had to take it back a couple a years
when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact

i bet that they knew it cause in my mind i play through it
and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do
cause its my opinion my life my potentials for my wife
and i used to be eager to buy em the world
maybe im confused about what i desire from girls
either way im all alone got a feelin its on
cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

check
and nowadays some girls are the type of person that
will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin
since i aint made them a purchase yet
but theres logic behind it
emotions double and they try to cover up
like a mansion with the projects behind it
i tend to freak with this
i get a girl and pretend that i love the spendin
and all she gave was a decent kiss
thinkin she been spoiled
but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days
and come up with tin foil

we could dissect it see
you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets
and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
gave her nothing
her reputations in jeopardy
cause it aint take her  of that shopping to get her next to me
collectively i look for a proper chick thatll rep for me
instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me
for thinkin that exists i got a feeling im wrong
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone


look
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes at the bar with a freak and
steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech cause

im from the city where people be gettin lazy
litterin in the streets
and the club district is poppin like literally every week
and promotersll push flyers
money exchange hands
liars sell you they dreams
and dummies exchange plans
hustlers give you events
bouncers give you pass
directors give em a shot
so girlsll give up the ass

and groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
daffy and bugs its all laughing and hugs
till the dude catch a plane
and she back where she was
right back on the bus
its ashame cause now at his rental
she throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
you can see thats shes colder
cause he doesnt hold her
fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
know that he tried ta told her
that he couldnt mold her
if this the type of chick you wanna be when you older i say

if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes at the bar with a freak and
steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech cause

now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
and im one of em the other four you know who you are
but if you gotta think through
chances are that it aint you
i singlehandedly carry out what you cant do
and see i take a couple of breathers
and then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
if you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
go ahead i couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers
but uh the in and the out
whenever im out in memphis the man seen as trill
and every verse the man seem to kill
you can find him with black jays and socks like im andreena mill
japan and brazil the audience acreaming
and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
advances to deals financing appeals
the hustles i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes in the bar with a freak and
steady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech cause


uh yeah get in my slick rick mode
na mean im a tell ya a story real quick

look
she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
crib was  mil plus i just bought a couch for ten grand
even if the house was ten grand
and there was no pool
would i still be witout my swim fan
the ceiling could be higher
she making requests
dont know if she feeling me or she be feelin what i buy her
and purses are light now
she use em all the time
so she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
and she simply a new model
stay spendin dollars
but she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
at times she a solid chick
and im a sucka for the cuties
so she always lookin good when my wallets thick
chillin on the linen she all up in the closet so much
got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
want the diamonds on the face in the center
nice guys finish last so im winnin every race that i enter and she a

video girl
eh yo you have to listen
im in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldnt call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same

and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cause i cant stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

youre all the same
look at vida guerrera
theres no need to compare her
i bet she smiles cause she loves what she sees in the mirror
i bet shes out meetin directors instead
and frustratrated cause shes already been addressed in they head
be a teacher open up shop if you can do nails fine
apply for a business loan and ill bet you that theyll sign
if you a real dime
poppin as if its your only option
girl theres things to do
other than jail time
look this aint a song dissing half of these rappers
or pasha and sasha esther baxter
melyssa ford or katy or anyone after
i just give my opinion for laughter
or maybe to think on
so next time you out at the club
and a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
you just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on
now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
look you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
and as ya man i wont back down first
but they got you doing softcore background work
that messed up like an officer that pulls you over
and he ask questions later and pat down first
but you aint thandie newton and this aint crash here
the resolutions passed baby this aint last year
look i got a message ill say it
i got some beats still
regina hall and garcelle and alice neal
young girls these here women with big dreams
role models that you can watch on the big screen
if you refuse to change and you that chick still
respect yourself dont be convinced that these tricks will
you got an audience believe it or not
my cousin who cant speak know the lyrics to tip drill

video girl
eh yo you have to listen
im in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldnt call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same
and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cause i cant stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

and i aint trying ta generalize every video girl you na mean
say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
accept the fact that theres times that you gotta better yourself
you know as a person man i love to see my black women strong single
independent doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
video you na mean its a wonderful thing baby so uh dont hate me for
this one ladies just take my advice you na mean cause its like uh
if she beautiful and honey dances
and you always downtown making money transfers
and anything the color of braces she get excited
she always showing up at these places she get invited
she a video girl


yeah this dedicated to canada man
the whole up north
a lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the winter
but listen

i met this new girl late june or early july
i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi
i swear that i never called you cause i really get shy
see that was a segue i believe the matter
is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter
where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up
where girls become exes from summers caught hoin
the winter cars come out the summer cars go in
and some places is breezy and some it start snowing
and if you planning family vacations you better know when
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
cause mom stays up late she seen them videos
where cancun college students pouring water on their titties

yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one
but just wait nah mean take it slow

forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet
since im driving i ask her how to get the suite
she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat
she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat
shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet
then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat
i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat
i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good
theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat
off this im kinda takin it back for a second
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch
until we end up sexin and now my heart attached
im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern
and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho

yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right
uh ya man its what it is

and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench
she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench
but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
she tellin everyone imma hold here down
tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town
and stupid me i just listen to her
instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round
the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
when we were together it seeming like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for marriage she saving for carrabanna
and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime
i guess i lost another one to the wintertime

strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing

i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up
now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup
with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right
and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
the winter came and blew his cold air through
back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
by the end of the week i would know that crew
and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin
we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
but this summer is different its a two man operation
granted the fact that we one man short
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
cause handin them crack is a one man sport
instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin
the face the breast the bras the toes
cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
well never talk again scary and true
that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified
its what im lookin for to carry me through
yet i cant seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it
and when they talk about they past and lovers
and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others
yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride
theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive

strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing

when im the only one thats really spittin

uh im bringing back hip hop
va toronto hiphop

aiight let me take my jacket off
unlace the timbs here again comes the jabberjaw
this time im blabbin on
these rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
mad cause the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
i got the gift like santa claus
flow got spring like a catapult
matter fact the flow supreme like diana ross
im at the do like a deer with the antlers off
wouldnt even give my man a  bar feature
i know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
i said nah lets keep it peaceful
he gave it to us for a cheap cost for prices we all could eat off
a real street dog
we have an impostor alert the doctor
bout to hit him up with the chopper like blaka
shock em like blanca from street fighter heat got a
hurricane kick murder everything quick
look my new ryu nine is stupendous
why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
my crew lie you guys into ditches
i said it and meant it the scorpios mind has many dimensions
ill say it in intent sentence indent on instant pimpin
hope your listenin to my diction
if you are then you now should be itchin
that its crack we placed in your stereo system
yeah i be at your burial trippin
nickelus f from richmond
va
the scorpios mind is not a game to play wit all day

ive been hated by many wanted by plenty
disliked by some but confronted by none
since they dont show me sincerity i load up lock up
take shots at em i guess you could call it a parody
but compared to d
they onefourth from watermelon to a quarter felon dude you a pear to me
if thats not how it is it aint how it appear to be
you got blind heaters in my sweats is a mind reader
and when the psychic get to touchin my palm
seein your physical the things that you never say to me visible
especially when one of your artist feelin threatened
cause im harnessin a weapon wont you pardon my reflection
mirror mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
to play around to perfection im the spittin image
my verbal camp is vivid i told you im spittin image
it seems we often want to start but never get to finish
my verbal campus is villanova and those of you feelin hova
and writing college rhymes but the thrill is over
let me assist you like a specialist
so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
its not a problem wit x i guess im a pessimist
and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate
instead of understanding its a tune of hate
the citys mine like oklahomas a sooner state
and were gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
so why dont you walk up in the spot using less strut
you aint morris chestnut you lighter and less cut
and lets be honest by now you should be your own scholar
you still a protege thats the reason i dont holler
you got rappers being repetitive actors
you stay ahead of the game im ahead of the practice boi

the samples that they using cant get through the clearing
ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it
my fathers early careering forced my parents to split up
my mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up
with just being a florist the choir sang his chorus
and he got back into doing what he was doing before us
because money is an issue your son he gon miss you
and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
now you looking for exes you aint never expect this
you end up doing time and me i end up with a stepsis
nobody passing judgment or question where the drugs went
you know i hold you down because without you id be a wasnt
and mommy ima support her i keep it all in order
see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
but

i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
im just trying to live my life cause
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cause bo bo bo bo
im just trying to live my life cause
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cause bo bo bo bo

this is my life and so the rest is kinda been cool question what i been through
i write a verse addressing it and yes i might offend you
picture when i was in school
me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what i was into
rest of the kids were sheltered i never liked to fight
now im grown i can say what it is
its parents that got these black and filipino nannies raising they kids
and your daddy want it very right
i make you happy plus im jewish he dont approve i think he want you to marry white
he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white
because black is black honey even if hes very light
and so i never been for dinner at they places
always brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces
i live it so the case is whether drake is
way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist

i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
im just trying to live my life cause
make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cause bo bo bo bo
im just trying to live my life cause
make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cause bo bo bo bo

am i hot as the rest should i strive for my spot as the best
like girls with double ds i gotta lot on my chest
theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test
and yes when im dismissed after a tedious listen
i sit at home and say i should have been a pediatrician
homie i probably could have been on tv consistent
an artist like pablo or maybe peteys assistant
and my mindset is come and get me
im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody running with me
so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson
if not you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond
last couple of months i done probably been
around the world and back and i dont wanna question half the places nick been

im just trying to live my life cause
make a little money find a bunny
make a little money find a bunny


yeah
check

sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough
to feel what im about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just wanna be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling its wrong
it is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snappin
and they try to make you out as a lie
symbolic cause you were just trying to please em by using logic and reason
its a loselose why even try
when your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics
to try and make em a mill
you never noticed the fact you might be working what im receivin at first
i mean theres always some blame to put on yourselves stead of claimin you couldnt help
and maybe next time you aint in town

you gonna try to try harder cause
try harder cause
try trytrytry

and the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spittin the pressure
than most of the rappers running the game
concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit to cash
theres time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience
that made you tell anybody i meet that i ran
sometimes i wish that i woulda just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers
cause im really telling me what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time
i wasted late out at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i working hard on the winner
so this album is a labour of love
you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
then she can rest without a toss or a turn
cause she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv
thats exactly why i often get burned
but im gonna try to

try harder cause
try trytrytry


uh what up yall
soundtrack whats popping baby
yall aint know i go by the name of lupe fiasco
representing that first and fifteen
jyea uh
and this one right here
i dedicate this one right here
to all my homies out there grinding
you know what im saying
legally and illegally
hahaha
you know what im talking about
so check it out

first got it when he was six
didnt know any tricks
matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
landed on his hip
and bust his lip
for a week he had to talk with a lisp
like thisssss
now we can end the story right here
but shorty didnt quit there was something in the air
yeah he said it was something so appealing
he couldnt fight the feeling
something about it
he knew he couldnt doubt it
couldnt understand it
brand it just the first kickflip he land it
uh labeled a misfit a bandit
kakunk kakunk kakunk
his neighbors couldnt stand it so
he was banished to the park
started in the morning wouldnt stop till after dark
yeah when they said its getting late in here
so im sorry young man theres no skating here

and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so lets kick and push and coast

my style is very tennessee
mixed with some terry kennedy
people barley remember me from back in the day
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
luckly my aunt working as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus shed always give me speeches on the first
if i m staying in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she say you need to be doing something other than skating
why dont you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey hes waiting
so now its me and old school
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
he knew i didnt really wanna post here
open up the window told me that the coast clear
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
homie this is recess east test
lifes ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes im literly landel lewis with a kick and a snare
kick flip in the air
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
just so the space aint restricted in here
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
i say aunty this is a safe career
she said drake i told you theres no skating here

and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so lets kick and push and coast

before he knew he had a crew
that wasnt no punk
and they spitfire shirts
and sb dunks
they would push till they couldnt skate no more
office building lobbies wasnt safe no more
and it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing they said
any escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy
they needed to break out
they head to any place with stairs
any good grinds
the world was theirs
uh and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said theres no skating here

and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so lets kick and push and coast


after this i dont have a choice i got people to provide for promises ive made and goals to meet hmm what chu got

but at this point im just pocking a body with a stick
now a days rapping is a childrens hobby

i tell them myself who i am feeling probably
just because i gotta buzz like a building lobby
it aint a song that your ass finna skipp
i tryd to sell weed give me cash for this zip
the way your girlfriend pump me up in the car
seem like she dont really need no gas for the trip
millionare shades fade with the waves

after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies
i aint lyin i aint lyin i aint lyin

i was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
running from polices jumping over fences
serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
the teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
make your outlook on life different damn you look suspicious
my granddad died a boss and thats been on my memory
if you listen closer to me feel the pain in my delivery
the struggle and the pain i still remain the same
im grinding so hard im just strengthening up my brain
flyer then the plain moving faster then the train

after the struggle and the pain
and to remain in the game
after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies
i aint lyin i aint lyin i aint lyin

damn it feel like yesterday im at the corner store
when the popo ran up on me in mexico
i dropped the blow i swear i never ran that fast before
and when i play it back in my memory in the studio
i swear i grind and i grind going hard every time
going hard on my grind
i write a hundred songs every time i think of this
take a  liter fill it up with codeine
and im a ride im a ride
until the rubber off the tires only the strong survive

after the struggle and the pain
and to remain in the game
after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies
i aint lyin i aint lyin i aint lyin

my glasses made from germany designer on me permanently
these scars on me permanently this pain insides burning me
but it aint killing me its boosting up my energy
im on my way to tennessee doing a show for  a key
and these streets theyre a beast out here
i dont plan on coming home i might leave you this year
so many lies so many broken promises
but you dont take it no more you sick and tired of it

after the struggle and the pain
and to remain in the game
after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies

when i was 
it was a very good year
it was a very good year
for city girls
who lived up the stairs
with all that perfumed hair
and it came undone
when i was 

it was all a dream just a year ago
bussin tables and servin food but yall dont hear it though
now im on another level but yall arent near it though
my soul bleedin on the track so spiritual
its a blessing cause now rappin is my profession yo
set to detonate im just waitin for my time to blow
white boy at first glance but when i rhyme they know
its been a year and everything i said would happened has
while everybody that i know is out havin a blast
i was right here in the studio bustin my ass
and now i got this
i taste the blood no one can stop this
second i drop this die hard fans is finna cop this
while the rest of the world follows through fiber optics
i took my time see i studied the game learned how to rhyme
i was around drugs and gats but never delved in crime
had other things in mind so i began to grind
first tape was a success
locally i got press
but i knew this one right here would run the world a mess but i digress
a year ago i was a youngin in his room
staring out the window lookin at the moon knowing its coming soon
but today i board this rocket ship and sonic boom
cause i am no longer a seed homie its time to bloom


we should shine a light on a light on
and the book i write on write on it was right on
we should shine a light on a light on
and the book i write on write on it was right on
we should shine a light on a light on
and the book i write on write on it was right on
we should shine a light on a light on
and the book i write on write on it was right on

they lost it i found it we leave em astounded
asking me how you so fly yet you still so grounded
i replied i died inside resurrected a beast
leave em deceased musics in my genes like a crease
got it capisce hungry as hell trying to eat now
success is the only thing that can complete us
grinding to free us the beat knocking like a fetus
close your eyes open up your ears so you can see this
now ive accepted im not from the hood
cause selling crack and busting gats dont make my raps good
see this is me logic repping md to the fullest
push us to the limit but never pull us now
i cant wait til i see my name in neon
every day i take chances celine dion
im a diamond in a rough but i shine like discos
surrounded by greasy people like i doused them in crisco
i havent shined yet so tell me where does the rest go
up a million percent until they finally hear this though
bumping up in they city like oh my god this go
my business getting better every year like fiscal
im original see but they trace like stencil
i stain in the game but you fade like pencil
biting off of my rhymes that aint even an insult
it takes  millions years for a diamond to shine
i did it in  see im ahead of my time
cause when i flow the crowd never roll cause i rock
on the road to success haters in my blind spot

we should shine a light on a light on
and the book i write on write on it was right on



see all i ever wanted was a window to sit close to
and you dont understand but in the end you aint supposed to
im talking first class  feet under my ass
living life on the dash constant pursuit of cash
now im living a life that you and yours could only dream about
rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror
until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer
see this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days
fast forward to the present rappers have no class like snow days
good god let me bring it back to hiphops first renaissance
 koolaid and sega genesis

hey yo hey yo how you keep it so real
i love the way your lyrics make me feel
roll it and get high light it up and fly
feeling like im  feet up in the sky

i got em saying

hey yo hey yo how you keep it so real
i love the way your lyrics make me feel
roll it and get high light it up and fly
feeling like im  feet up in the sky

so many people think that they know my whole situation
conversations with people that handle public relations
nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations
slowly pacing until i kill like that boy jason
it aint nothing never folding or bluffin
kiss em touch em and rub em
hit it fast but then i slow it down like robitussin
shorty giving me brain until concussion
the club run out of vodka the second we rush in
never under estimate the power in which im bustin
my lyricism got yo girl blushin
award shows chilling with all my bros
threepiece ralph lauren and some jordans i suppose


ayo shout out to black diamond i got them nikes on my feet as we speak homie shout out to mac miller

and at this moment in time im on a road when i write this rhyme
sitting behind raheem devaughn while hes passed out
bout to hit the station fore our gas is out
look outside the window i see shorties with they asses out oh my

day dreaming out the window watch how buildings pass me by
see i aint signed but at this point in time
im feeling like the th
wonder of the world just might steal your girl

ever since i was a youngin i knew id break in the game
while you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained
i was strategizing before the people knew my name
fame what i shall attain on the road to success
bumping jay in the hov lane
searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
i know we fight but thats poquito
unless you do me foul like a free throw then we finito

all i do is grind play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine tour the world aint it funny

homie this is food for thought you better fill up
im coming in strong with a song for very long
so i gotta make you understand before the beat is gone
homie you are not alone we are in the zone
living in a world of lies i cant take it
needed someone to save me needed someone to hug me
needed a whole world but nobody would love me
had i learned from this that people wanna buck me
had i learned from this that people wanna buck me
i said i cant take it i know im gonna make it
i know im not normal but i gotta fake it
i swear im not cocky i am just confident
that when i step on the stage i am dominant and now i am beggin

beggin beggin you
put yo loving hand out baby
beggin beggin you
put yo loving hand out darling

sick of living in the dark so im begging for the light
feeling like im in a fight every single time a write
cause i gotta make sure that they hear me right
told me that i couldnt do it so when i pick up the mic
i gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it
they can feel whats in my soul
lyrical cocaine yeah homie i got a blow
but first they gotta know who i is
so im begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big
cause i aint new to this im true to this
thinking im a stand up and roll out homie thats ludacris
not here to play no games im here to stay and make a change
and mate your ways so i remain
im in the studio for days and days
spittin out these razorblades dont wanna place no blame
but without you i couldnt get to where im headding
so to everybody im begging

beggin beggin you
put yo loving hand out baby
beggin beggin you
put yo loving hand out darling

yeah yeah i said this is my path dont mess with me
i didnt choose this life it was destiny
god tested me to find the best of me
and i know im going to make it even without a degree
and when you said that i would fail it didnt get to me
now im begging public masses please
im way to proud to get down on my knees
but im begging on another level
cause i am not about that i just wanna love
i just wanna grow i just wanna learn
the pass and the verbs to write this music
im so late that i just might lose it
but dont ever confuse it its all so worth it
i just wanna help it but not hurt it
and as for my style i dont know how to word it
why do you even have to categorize me
cause im gonna take this fill it up and make this
something that the whole word cannot imagine
let alone fathom im from another planet
i swear im not mathic listen to me dammit
my futures in your hands and so im beggin

beggin beggin you
put yo loving hand out baby
beggin beggin you
put yo loving hand out darling


logic
music shows relationships fame happiness music fortune staying humble music fans grinding shows music touring money fate music god fear bills friends enemies family music

step into the mind of a young man
and if you dont then i dont really give a damn
all i wanna do is make you understand
but if you dont wanna listen i guess you aint a part of the plan
sorry if i digress
all i ever wanted was to be the best
through lyricism to put your mind to the test
feelin bulletproof no vest but i confess
my minds a mess living in a world of stress i digest
but i gotta keep grinding
cause everyday success what im finding
and i dont give a damn if you hate on me
cause when i blow what you gon say homie
heh not a goddamn thing
but thats enough of that ima let my home girl sing

camille michelle gray
knocked down round for round
youre feeling like youre shot down on the ground
you might be knocked down round for round
youre feeling like youre shot down on the ground

logic
all i think about is music
dont get me wrong i think
about other things but this how i fuse it
so the whole wide world can use it
when you feel like you just might lose it
take a breath homie dont confuse it
take a step in the mind of logic
as long as you dont abuse it
so let me break it down for the whole world
like i broke it down for my old girl
no more gotta let it go let it unfurl
cause i remember the time
when i was living sublime wanted to make a living off of my rhymes
but the whole world told me never mind
im a star how could i not shine

camille michelle gray
knocked down round for round
youre feeling like youre shot down on the ground
you might be knocked down round for round
youre feeling like youre shot down on the ground

logic
i just wanna take it to another level
that ive never even been on so i can sit on
every single piece of paper that i put a pen on
and when i been on for like ten years
ima do it better than anybody before me
so the whole wide world will adore me and no need to assure me
and if you wonder why im rapping so fast
its cause i gotta lot of things on my mind
that wanna come out at the same time
in other words im racing
i used to pursue my dreams but now theyre reality
and thats what im chasing
why are we on this earth
why must we feel pain
why does everybody feel the need
to judge one another when were all the same

camille michelle gray
knocked down round for round
youre feeling like youre shot down on the ground
you might be knocked down round for round
youre feeling like youre shot down on the ground


i would like to make an announcement
to everybody that said i wouldnt amount to anything
in the minds of music
i told you what did i tell you
didnt i tell you
cause i told you
mmhmm
and when did i tell you
a long time ago
and what did i say
what happen when i told you
exactly what just happened

breakfast at tiffanys
lunch at louis vs

girl with nice clothes
and thick curls

you shine like a star but i sun it
 keep it a  homie you know i run it
the game needs change and logic can break a 
i had a shorty to bun it until she didnt want it
so i focused on the flow and they gon put me on the map
with a pocket full of change every day a different dime
when i rhyme they up on me cause they seen how imma shine
now you may be wondering how my raps rock
cause im so fifth key to the right of caps lock
and when my tracks drop imma be sipping ciroc
with a whole skyline chilling in the backdrop

phil ade

i wouldnt wanna have it any other way
im addicted and i just cant get enough

knockin knockin doors down showing cause around
knockin doors down showing cause around
knockin knockin doors down showing cause around
ima imma come through and show my wood pine

logic
when people would joke around and say i signed with the devil
cause its gotta be a sin to be this good
yeah i been offered four of five deals
bust like banana clips boy thats four or five kills
doing the most accumulating so much bread
i think its time for toast and i aint talking fine wine
then when i blow like mine the whole world gon see me shine
this is the life that i should live homie
im never going back im addicted to the game

i wouldnt wanna have it any other way
im addicted and i just cant get enough

logic
im addicted to the game addicted to the pain
of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
living a life that most wont attain
and i know it is essential
for now i just be chillin with ballers
poppin collars pushing impalas cutting records and counting dollars
im addicted my lines is cocaine
and when they disperse blow minds like propane
and you know these haters that never made it this mad
cause they never had what we had
addicted to the game and im glad

knockin knockin doors down showing cause around
knockin doors down showing cause around
knockin knockin doors down showing cause around
ima imma come through and show my wood pine

i wouldnt wanna have it any other way
im addicted and i just cant get enough


logic taught me
so uh its been twentyfour hours got my money
oh uh you know what just give me till next friday ill have it for you
ohoh uh thats funny i couldve sworn i said have it today
yeah i dont have it sorry
oh well all right then
yeah thats what happens man

logic
im stewie griffin
and this game is brian
beatin the hell out of em
tryin to get this money
check the statistics
the chances of me blowin up are far from realistic
to have a chance at fame id never miss it
i know im gonna be famous cause my friends and family insisted
but its time to let off set off break this bread off
all i do is get this money
cut these records and cool out
but i kinda see it as louis vuitton day
cause when i step up on the stage
im snatchin mics like kanye
thats andre
three stacks i do it big
take no relax im spittin the facts
catch me in the booth droppin tracks
yeah they talkin bout me
yeah i know they talkin bout me
yeah i know they talkin bout me but
never face to face they evade it
by rappers im hated
because im fly while they just levitated
as the hating escalated
my flow it just elevated

logic
young jedi all i do is stack bread
i said i be in the crib bumpin red hot chili peppers
this right here for all my city reppers
fly talker sky walker get gritty reppers
follow your dreams this life aint what it seems
they used to tell me id never make it
now my flow streams
across the world spit lyrics let them unfurl
poetic rhetoric my girl
got my mind playin tricks on me
my eyes is closed the ice is froze i got it
hiphop was never dead but it was fallin
and i caught it
the way i process chips you think my brains robotic
i went from switchin lanes in the rain
to switchin planes with dames
poppin champagne spittin game and gettin brain

stewie griffin
dont bring that trash in here this is my house


making so many moves i need a dose of dramamine
for rap im a fiend come and test my team
my cerebral cortex force my trigger finger reflex
to bust tecs like raw sex aint no tellin whats next
i sling mixtapes like crack rocks
watch snow bunnies chillin in the backdrop discussin how the track rocks
goddamn im a miraculous man
and if i wasnt logic id be his number one fan
beware im spittin fire cause the world is in dire need of an mc to admire
and set the bar higher
so i conspire within my mind just had a friar
the rap messiah fresh to death so peep the attire
feelin like b rabbit when he slaughtered the lotto
you say potato i say potato
you call em rappers but all i see is comedians
mcs approach take notes and then i bury them
im out of this world my studios the planetarium
the second i utter lyricism that leave all the rest in the gutter
i thought i told yall im the best dddid i stutter
ill hit your mom in the head with a car bomb just to blow her mind like vietnam
had a myspace account but my only friend was tom
psych its a joke i swear that im not racist
to be honest ill murder you no matter what color your face is
punch you in the face if i catch you slippin in braces
you want beef ill choke you to death with your own shoelaces
psych i swear im not a violent guy
once upon time i brought a super soaker to a driveby
full of koolaid and warm piss
my buzz is growing every day and when the swarm hits
million dollar trips sex at the ritz
blow the competition to bits leavin the enemy lit
but im out cause theres women to please and money to get
its logic


logic
various women im swimming in like a shark
hold up that was the first one
let me run it back and restart
young sinatra ripping the beat apart
shining like a diamond
when i be rhyming
but yall in the dark
on point like a poisonous dart
i can feel it now
the fame is coming soon
how can sky be the limit when theres footprints on the moon
now i used to bus tables now i bust rhymes
spitting lines to the illest of dimes
just to pass the time
living like a don
mafietic mind state
hiphop heads never die we multiply then dominate
now i been flowing since a adolescent up until the present
rehearsing flows for various shows
yeah thats how i roll
getting respect and never neglect
that as i infect they detect it and when i dissect
rip it and wreck it now
thats on the record
as the vinyl spin so slowly
bringing verses like a holy
bible my flow is tribal
meet me in the street homie im liable
to get it right then and there
he come from
got music for days and then some
they were stepping confident until i made em run
you know its logic
in your vicinity murder evil entities
better known as your enemies
you feel it now
spark the l and you be coolin
chillin relaxin to this audio satisfaction
i leave mcs missin in action
leave you gashin
from a thousand lashes
why im laughing with a passion
standing over you smiling
till i hear sirens then im dashing

az and nas
that buck that bought the bottle
coulda struck the lotto
got rhymes  days and plus some

logic
this second verse is dedicated to rappers that never made it
cause they gave up on their dream
in other words they hesitated to take it
but i swear imma make it better than ever before
cause half of yall dont even know
see i be rolling through the streets
in a beamer bomber like hiroshima
gonna hit you like katrina until they like damn gina
i eat mcs like fast food
hella rude
im the reason that your favorite rappers in a bad mood
my name is logic
i was born in 
aint no need to remind me
that when you listen you wanna rewind me
all the labels wanna sign me
for the right reason
we aim to please
hunting dollars and its buck season
cause

az
thats why we get high
cause you never know when youre gonna go
thats why we puff lye
cause you never know when youre gonna go
thats why we get high
cause you never know when youre gonna go



aight yeah yeah homie im comin
im coming and im never gonna give up
my mentality is making rappers feel like
they can never even live up to logic
you bust i dodge it
think you seein me nah you just miragin
im gunnin im gunnin like a semiautomatic
thats really equipped with lyricism ill let em have it
i blast it any style that you comin at me with


yeah you know i had to keep it going
kid rhymes that blow minds and see foreign
real recognize real and you lookin foreign
i was spittin flows before i was even born in the womb
and im a keep it up until the tomb
and as for the fame yeah i know its coming soon
cause im goin in raw finna bust up in your room
i hit a beat and its ergence to emerge in the game
pukin the dukins im too sick to spit that yoga flame
the way i figure this is rap second renassaince
spittin dirty sentences so ill they affecting medicine
ha im havin sentence spittin fire like a demon
as the internet i let my flow to get to streamin im beamin
flawlessly listen in that women in yo head while you dreamin
tryna get you to buy that album tryna get you feenin
see my vision as i commentate it
you wanna see naked rerun of the bait but the hater ate it
success is truly overrated
ive seen caster with a blow up to pop and get deflated
see yeah you made it but all your fans hate it
and its kinda lookin like you were sittin negotiatin
when it comes down to the rap game you see im integrated
half white half black i had it incorporated
get the money


yeah im just a youngin with a dream
with expenses till sixteen
quite the microphone fiend
now the rap is not mean
when i step up on the scene
all the girls see my scheme
till i open up my mouth and they find out my lyrics mean
had i meet up with raheem
drinkin a whole team
but before i execute a perfect plan i gotta scheme
cause right now im on the dolo
everything about this tape i did it on the solo
yeah i said its hurricane logic
remember they cant dodge it
they gon be bumpin me from the birds to the projects
i get on the mic and excite anybody around me
youre probably wondering why the boy has not found me
its not that easy i gotta work from the ground
be the center of attention look at the people around me
black on the inside my outside ritz
whats a cracker without a cheese
i gotta stack chips

you have interfered with our affairs for the last time


oh oh ah
take it take it take it
take it slow
take it take it take it
take it slow

shawty i dont know you
but you know im trying to get to
know you think im fine but my mind thats what gets you
so let me lay you down baby girl let me split you
yes you know i want it but first ima get to know you
cause this aint about your body take my hand and let me show you
now what we have is partnership i wont try to control you
i just want to ride i just want to fly

i just want to take it slow
baby you already know
i just want to take it slow

i just want to take it slow
baby you already know
i just want to take it slow

baby girl i think i really want to speed it up
lay you in the bed kiss slow let me heat it up
but i promise ill be gentle when i beat it up
never do it on the regular but imma eat it up
kiss you touch you tease you
doing anything and everything i need to please you
what it is momma let me know right now
aint no need to talk i just want to bite down
on your bottom lip let your bra rip open
never had a feeling like this and im hoping
we could do it again never thought i could find heaven within
a heart of a woman and now i begin
to understand more than i did from the start
gimme your heart trust me with love
baby girl i swear you fell from above
lend me your hand ill be your man
i promise to do everything that i can
ill be your sinatra be my monroe
give me your heart and ill know it will grow
i put it on everything baby my love is yours for the taking my darling my drug
and now i know and now i know


lykke li
watch my back so i make sure
youre right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you wont know
dry my eyes so i wont show
i know youre right behind me


thought we knew it all but just couldnt predict the weather
i think about you and imagine a house and some kids
i wonder if you found another and its all his
see baby girl i know you love me even through the lies
cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes
sometimes i see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl i know you hear it
and even though the time is wrong i know the love is right
thats why theres so much emotion whenever i recite
anything about this angel that lost its sight
baby you were my everything but you playing games
but you aint worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action
i used to count the days with you but now i just subtract them

lykke li
watch my back so i make sure
youre right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you wont know
dry my eyes so i wont show
i know youre right behind me

you were my best friend but then you out me
i never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me
i write it so that the people can feel better
that have gone through what ive gone through
memories of a perfect love thats broken and haunt you
and if you think i write this song to taunt you
i dont want you i want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday
and have an endless love with an angel from up above
but now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
and another path within my life is calling
even my music and when you left me i didnt lose it
i channeled deep within emotions and used it
my heart you broke it and bruised it
so now i address this microphone and just ooze it

lykke li
watch my back so i make sure
youre right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you wont know
dry my eyes so i wont show
i know youre right behind me

watch my back so i make sure
youre right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you wont know
dry my eyes so i wont show
i know youre right behind me


logic
i am not a poet i am just a designer of words
architect of sentences the way i form and merge
paragraphs together that force emcees to submerge
with an urge to break free of this biracial jail cell
feast on my memories please come and taste this
papa was a black man mama was a racist
while the whites got whiter and the blacks got blacker
i was hurting doing everything i can
perceived as a white boy with the soul of a black man
goddamn looking up to malcolm x
studying his speeches underlining text
how can i be white devil if my parents had sex
cause im black and im white
and im proud of every word that i recite
i know my roots i know my past
i know the issue of my race aint gonna last
we all breathe the same air and bleed the same blood
and when we die the same ditch gets dug



im on the come up
anything that yall do im one up
yall grind till like  in the morning
i grind till the sun up
homie thats dedication
this world is what im facing
i only hope in the end that they all love and embrace me

but its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
momma im sorry that i left at 

logic
everything aint what it seem when you try and follow your dreams
first you saw the bigger picture
now you see behind the scenes
you thought everything was sweet
got a taste now you a fiend
been into it since a teen
yeah he nice so all his friends say he gon blow like hiroshim
himself on the cover of vibe magazine
but everything aint what it seems
though it seem like he gon blow
will he make it
maybe so
too be honest i dont know
he got lyrics he got flow
but it takes so much mo
so much love
so much pain
with such little time to grow
yeah we love it when he smile
but hate it when he frown
remember when that girl turned his world upside down
but it made his music better
brought emotion made it clever
now we growing everyday
but he hungry try to eat
brain like an ekg the way that he study the beat
now we know that he gon make it and he wont accept defeat
now i aint tryin to be mean
now i aint tryin to be mean
but everything aint what it seem

logic
so many times did i design a rhyme to blow your mind
cause i know that i wasnt destined to live a life of crime
i remember christmass with no presents
i use to fear my future now i dread my adolescence
living a life of logic
but it aint what its cut out to be
hip hop is politics
filled with nothing but strife and stress
time is money and its hard to invest
step on the stage i get the honeys so wet
rockin thousand dollar tuxes sippin on nothing but moet
this game is war and in my mind im like a vietnam vet
now im on the come up
anything that yall do ill one up
yall grind till  in the morning i grind till the sun up
homie thats dedication
this world is what im facing
i only hope in the end that they all love and embrace em

slowly elevated escalated onto another level ha
my flow is crack the game is whitney yeah
fame is bobby on their first date it aint hit me yet
visualizing driving down the horizon
while you despising the fact that im rising
steppin to me yeah you better be alphabetically ready
aim steady
lyricism sharp as machete
i got it already
see i was born to sell records
you was destined to sell tunes
all up your headphones
killing booths like cellphones
cause everything aint what is seems
it aint just him it takes a team
at the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean
yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety
now ive had a lot of doubt
but i had to throw that out
cause i find that they listen when i rhyme not when i shout
with me and my girl
see music is my moon but this shawty is my world
think about you all the time
cause sometimes you can ignore me
but the beat listens just fine
tell me do you even know
if you truly want to grow
hate letters when im writing love jones all i know
cause everything aint what it seems

living a life you only dream about
flow angelic but now its time to bring the demon out
can you feel me
i said its hard being a saint inside a sinners body
you know its hard living as logic after living as bobby
this is the life i depicted
as a child i picked it
feeling conflicted
to music i am addicted
not one of yall can predict it
so many bars im feeling convicted
now writing like a felon im selling homie who you telling
a level you aint seen
a level that is truly only deemed for a king cause
the second you listen its my mission to murder any rendition
busting with precision
if you in my vision im never missing
logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener


i know what its like
to be all all depressed
and not wanna go out and
and live life man
thats not healthy man
you cant be living like that whats wrong with you

hi
yeah hey you yeah you

and youre gonna make it some way
no more waitin for the bus
and no more riding on the subway
live life how you want to
so get on up now go get out there
face your fears
no need to be scared
you better rebel
and if they hate you give em hell
no more hiding in your shell
cause we are not defined
by how hard we fall
so dust yourself off and stand tall
cause you can make it
of this im sure
just spread your wings
and you will soar

i know
i know know
that im gonna blow
you away
and when i wake up
im gonna shake up
and youre gonna love me
youre gonna take me
and not a single one of you
can tell me no
oh yeah

imma go where nobody before me has gone
and i know that the journey is gonna be long
livin life like a mademan like a don
i was in the dark but now all the lights on
its real hard on the rise to fame
cause everybodys mad and youre the one to blame
and just last year you didnt know my name  logic
now they all demand it
used to hate me and i cant stand it
cause now you love me you so damn manic
said ill never make it said ill fail
my ship would sink
i know im gonna prevail
eyes on the prize right on my trail
middle finger to the haters that are on my tail
cause i got heart boy i got spunk
feelin just like jordan before the dunk
ha im just playin around
oooowwwwww

i swear to god that i love the life i live
and im grateful for every breathe it gives
i remember thinkin somethings got to give
new day but it all just feels the same
no clouds but i can feel the rain
till i came across my own name
i wasnt in control of my destiny
feelin empty thinkin wheres the rest of me
i gotta make it but i need the recipe
only then will i find the best of me
i was so selfish i was so stuck
cleanin up food for a little buck
then i quit that livin on luck
i was so lost at what cost
why be the worker when you could be the boss
still doin wrong trynna live right
get my mind righteous man i what a fight
and my girl left so i just might
so i just might
go home to where the wild things roam and uh
happiness last and uh
go home to where the wild things roam and uh
happiness last and uh


logic
will i make it i dont know
from the bottom of my heart i swear to god i gotta blow
this for every time the world told me no
if i dont make it in this game i aint got nowhere else to go
from the drama to the hoes
from the records to the shows
i gotta make it and if they dont give me what i deserve
then imma take it ive been underrated underestimated and hated
but i cant wait to look back and say that i made it
cause nowadays everyones a rapper and i hate it

yall dont knowohohohknowohohoh
said yall dont knowohohohknowohohoh

i had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears
while you was out partying chilling and sipping on some beers
i was sacrificing adolescent years
blood sweat and tears to find out what music really is
and now im feeling im feeling like the moment has arrived
with bobby is no longer living and logic has revived
lyricism thats driven from a master you bastards

just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way

logic
all i ever wanted was some financial security
now im colder than ever pushing through any weather
high score flow aint none of yall close to my level
mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner
visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner
noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner

yall dont knowohohohknowohohoh
said yall dont knowohohohknowohohoh

just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way
just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way

logic
you know my steelo busting shots like free throws
is it a blessing that im messing with girls
that wanna undress in the back of my car
or is it just cause im a star or is it just cause im a star
 foot  looked like she fell from heaven
with an ass hotter than the devil please call a reverend
she was black and asian part hispanic and part amazing
women they feen us merely because we are the keenest
my heart only has one love like serena and venus
you know i am the meanest genius with the biggesthey
see baby girl i know you got some problems
just know im here to solve em revolve em cock em back and dissolve em
i swear i take care of all em but you gotta trust it
love it open your heart before you lust it
now bust it what

just another day living in the hood
just another day living in the hood
just ajust anotherjust anotherjust another day
just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way
just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way


i got a date with destiny
my heart says yeah but cant convince the rest of me
i tried so hard to make it with no recipe
my selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
i need redemption no need to mention my past
cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
the glits the glamore the lights the camera the action
the stage the fans the speakers blastin
you know im wanted i need it dont doubt it i cant live without it
its just everything i dreamed of
its everything ive ever wanted
but is it really truly in my plans
or did god mix up my blue prints
did he have it right there in his hands

anybody give me a hint
i can feel it now i know its coming
ive fallen ive risen i chose to select to dismiss an incarnation through these bars createda prison
and i intend to do the time and the sentence thats given
 to life yeah thats how im living
sometimes i wonder if ill ever make it
but theres only way imma know
im like a seed planted in the dirt
feels like ive been waiting forever to grow
and maybe today is the day
but one thing that i know for sure
this time imma get it right


i dont want to rule or conquer anyone
i should like to help everyone if possible jew gentile black man white
we all want to help one another human beings are like that
we all want to live by each others happiness not by each others misery
we dont want to hate and despise one another
in this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone
the way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way
greed has poisoned mens souls
sinatra
sinatra shot ya god damn you
is this what you want
logic
you are watching a master at work
you have interfered with our affairs for the last time
many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons
fans telling me never change but its harder fighting seasons
they hear me on the radio and now they yelling treason
cause logic giving them mainstreams like ephesians
but i never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow
the fame hit me quicker than previously determined
motivated by money sex drugs and violence
cause the era that we living it was built up on defiance
what we need is alliance but yall dont really hear me though
so hiphops a chariot and logics finna carry it
stallion coming for their necks like a medallion
straight out of sierra leone

cutting records after the show at my hotel while im touring
yeah and i aint even 
but my bank account can vouch im balling like an mvp
yes its me logic
im repping md
i work  hours a day every day with no distraction
 days a week and  hours thats a lazy day
going  hours with no sleep call that a crazy day
this is manhunt and i aint stopping till yall apprehended
many years i have attended and finally been commended
now pull out the mac and watch them freeze like pcs
i educate em with ease however listener please
dont knock that last line school it just wasnt for me
we all different
and im here to make a killing
so say hello to the villain cause in this day that we living
and the nice guys finish last
im blowing up
guess you could say im having a blast
sinatra shot ya god damn you
you are watching a master at work
is this what you want


dead presidents iii not to be confused with growing pains iii
logic this logic that logic sick logic wack
so many people think that rap is they calling stop it just cease
waitin on a record deal thats never cumming like a priest
black and white like a nun
these upandcomers our sun
like the break of dawn
never knowin whats gon follow
however we never wallow in our sorrow
just pray for tomorrow
at times my heart could be hallow
emotions forced to be swallowed
while neighborhood cats blast star gas like the apollo
this is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
one moment shell love you then swallow you whole like an anaconda
so with the lift of a pinky imma
dominate the world like my name was brain
spit flame like propane

allow me to kill it off the brink like no traffic
murderin every demographic
paint a picture using only blood to make sure that its graphic
rip the mic to set the example
constant thoughts of suicide
where living in an era thats do or die
society expects us to fail im talking about you and i
but we persevere force fear enemies saying we want nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
in your central nervous system like heroine reppin maryland to the fullest
bustin like bullets that travel through chambers that are ignited by triggers dont pull it
i go from point a to point b by keeping it g
aint no killer but dont push me
buckle up and tell me how you feel forget the steal
i have not a single enemy
only evil entities that have some how befriended me in they mind
cause i am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
and when it comes to dames i catch planes
they catch feelins
haters keep my name in they mouth like villains
high as the ceiling
yall really dont know who your dealing with now
visions of livin until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
im thankful for every breath im given
on the road to success and there aint no time for collision
people ask how you get your flow so amazing

to which i reply i have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions
haters taken shots but i never graze em
now if pro is the opposite of con
whats the opposite of progress
grew up on sex and they that i can attest
now if i dont believe it yall wont perceive it
now run it back and retrieve it
only  but i feel like im 
back in  thats when i began to rhyme
surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know i shine
daddy was smokin crack i was raised by a single mom
at  the school system dismissed him and wished him well
so i focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
i left home at 
but she still breathin which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
so many rappers biting me you would think they was teethin
and now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story


yeah
chillin with my homie sledro while he ignites the vapor
unless you talking suicide
cause i finally gotta little bit of money and a range in my drive way
with a rattpack smoking on zimbabwe
crankin sinatra that my way

vmg is uptodate but these businessmen be lackin
eve bit the apple steve changed the world
getting money like zuckerburg my bank account is sterol
i am not defined by that in which i do possess
i need drive in a lady not a girl that drive me crazy

spit fire like hades i infect it like rabies
its all that shout out to them s babies
never hesitate to supply the heat
shortcut to the desktop i am your newest icon
girl got them daddy problems thats why she be actin tough
innocent in person but in the bed she love it rough
running away from reality to sniff coke and puff
so let me get it the second i spit it you know that i did it all the people wanna come around
they used to hate it but now they love the sound

hey yo ill chop you up in sixteen pieces
in front of your nieces while im eating reeses
and wont even offer them any yes i spit plenty
this is east coast flow at its finest
in the studio where you find us put a bullet where your spine is
at sixteen i was skipping school and smoking chronic
while you was learning about english big l was teaching ebonics
i spit fire so demonic writing code like im masonite
a jedi master breaking it down like old plaster
no medication for this track cause this is how a psycho rips
my bank account is like a cino bolt your pockets microchips uh
whoop your ass and get arrested in a double breasted
louis vuitton diamond encrested tailor made suit
now thats all sinatra everything
i explode like hollow tips on contact

chronologically murder schmoe theres no bringing joe back
puffing cubans and sipping cognac
mafietic mentality introduce me to this beat and its fatality
i kill mics like conrad murray
sharp like hanzo steel the rest is obtuse
i get loose when sipping goose and rhyme like doc seuss
flow tight like noose whoop ass like bruce no time for a truce
alphabetical mathematic addict
i spit sixteens so erratic you think it was a semiautomatic
i know by now you thinking oh my god he let them have it
but that was just a loan time to collect like im capone
reep what ive sewn in other words that is the throne
chilling while homies smoking marijuan
cause for every emotion and every mood i have a song
for the club for the streets for the whip and for the sheets
cause this is where intellect and versatility meets
im young sinatra backstage chilling with bobbysoxers
i got ya

yeah


yeah pass the mic before i jack it like goretex
bust like raw sex rappers suck like vortex
the life of a don we living like kings and killing our pawns
boy the seconds its on  dont know where we going
that last line made no sense like these rappers careers
but i make dollars cause im all about the fiscal year
yeah you dont like me ill conjure up and summon all your fears
you wanna fight me ill woop my own ass before you get here
wanna write me and tell me that my rhymes suck
you can ask my ex i bust quicker than two techs
caressed by a kid with category  tourettes
in other words i squeeze with ease dot my is and cross my ts
its hiphop not to be taken literally
however on the light of note i stayed with bills like hilary
my flow convects murder subjects with little respect
best protect your neck before you play my tape better inspect the deck
sike im not that much of a dick when i rhyme
on another level like duplex bust heads like suplex
slaughter mcs then ask whos next
ey yo my crew next but you say you next so i guess we now
priceless flow so even if i write its still a freestyle
never busting gats i aint no gangster put that heat down
raise hell like im satans daddy while you in here

with the thickest fatty while i hit the gas you lick it gladly
its a fact that me and logic rip with vicious rap to list a wrap
we spittin crack to keep the fiends coming back to show world
reppin maryland but i make music for the whole world
seduce a chick with lyrics whenever she hear it it make her toes curl
so sick i hope i dont hurl if you love me let me go girl
spit it so thorough and in depth i bet i leave in you impressed
only interest is to blow up and watch they hands go up
cause i used to throw shows back then but no one would show up
i aint all about the money but i want it homie sho nuff
cause krispie crazy bout the cream you could say im doughnuts
we exchanged a couple words he said some things i didnt like
i said okay then punched him in the face with a butcher knife
i want more like ashton kutchers wife

ill dilapidate you grab the butter knife and decapitate you
we all have thoughts like this im just willing to admit it
i would never act upon these thoughts now dont you get it
but he never says it ill dump your body in a dessert

right in front of toucan sam and a whole damn bunch

but she wont drop out her parents will look at her funny
now tell me that aint insecure
the concept of school seems so secure
sophomore three yurrs aint picked a career
cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs
cause her babydaddy dont really care
shes so precious with the peer pressure
couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off now she look like eve
and she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
single black female addicted to retail and well

oh when it all it all falls down

man i promise im so selfconscious
thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollies and pashas done drove me crazy
i cant even pronounce nothing pass that versaysee
then i spent fourhundred bucks on this
and i cant even go to the grocery store
without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
it seems we living the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
we trying to buy back our forty acres
and for that paper look how low we a stoop


we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
wea buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need em
things we buy to cover up whats inside
cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
thats why shorties holler where the ballers at
drug dealer buy jordans crackhead buy crack
and a white man get paid off of all of that
but i aint even gonna act holier than thou
before i had a house and id do it again
cause i want to be on  and park pushin a benz
i want to act ballerific like its all terrific

you dont need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math
cats think im delirious but im so damn serious

im talking to you of my many inspirations
when i say i cant let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
and if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
in my grip i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it be known that gods penmanship has been signed
with a language called love
thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
and while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess im one of a kind in a full house
cause whenever i open my heart my soul or my mouth

when it comes to being true at least true to me

id like to propose a toast

so get your ass up off the wall

the all around the world digital underground pac
the rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the roc
i take my chain my fifteen seconds of fame
aint nobody expect kanye to end up on top
they expected that college dropout to drop and then flop
then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
my money was thinner than sean pauls goatee hair
now jean paul gaultier cologne fill the air here
they say he bougie he bigheaded
would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
flow infectious give me ten seconds
ill have a buzz bigger than insects in texas
its funny how wasnt nobody interested

so get your ass up off the wall

now was kanye the most overlooked yes sir
now is kanye the most overbooked yes sir
though the fans want the feeling of a tribe called quest
but all they got left is this guy called west
thatll take freeway throw him on tracks with mos def
call him kwali or kweli i put him on songs with jayz
im the gap like banana republic and old navy and ooh
it come out sweeter than old sadie
nice as bunb when i met him at the source awards
girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
and i was almost famous now everybody love kanye im almost raymond
some say he arrogant can yall blame him
it was straight embarrassing how yall played him
last year shoppin my demo i was tryin to shine
now i could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
i use it as my gas so they say that im gassed
but without it id be last so i ought to laugh
so i dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
im kan the louis vuitton don
bought my mom a purse now she louis vuitton mom
i aint play the hand i was dealt i changed my cards
i prayed to the skies and i changed my stars
i went to the malls and i balled too hard
oh my god is that a black card
i turned around and replied why yes
but i prefer the term african american express
brains power and muscle like dame puffy and russell
your boy back on his hustle you know what ive been up to
mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips

so get your ass up off the wall all

so this aampr over at rocafella named hip hop picked the truth beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me you know like i always do
i play the songs hes like who that spittin im like its me hes like oh well okay
uh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth
just askin me to send him beats and im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with
and um he was friends with my mentor no id
and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap
i was all i dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
i was messin with uh ddot also
people were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how i got in the game
if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here
i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and be able to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample
and at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me
so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic  at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled
and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life
and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management
i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude
and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take
and he said tell me what you think of this
and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz
i aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion
so he asked me what you think of it
you know what im sayin man what imma tell him
i was on the train man you know
so after that i went back home and man im im just in chicago im trying to do my thing
you know i got groups i got acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been
one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed
but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company
so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company
and i got evicted at the same time
so i went down and tracked the beats from him
so i aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk
me and my mother drove to newark new jersey
i hadnt even seen my apartment
you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city
and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats
and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time
but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
i remember it like like it was yesterday
and hip hop said yo play that one beat for him
so i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx
and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like ooh
two days later im in baseline and i seen dame
dame didnt know who i was and i was like yo whats up im kanye
so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days
i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story
the day i did the cant be life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly
and hip hop was there i think tyty john meneilly a bunch of people
i didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap
mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips
and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line
that was it you know i aint get no deal then haha
okay fast forward
so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single
and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
man yo i appreciate i love him for that
and at this time you know i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these aamprs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up id play them some beats
gimme a beat that sound like jayz you know they dick riders whatever
be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they didnt sign me
im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
lets just say i didnt get my deal
the person who actually kicked everything off was joe h from capitol records
he wanted to sign me really bad
dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure its not wack
then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs cause you know cam was in the room young guru and
dame was in the room
so i played actually its a song that youll never hear but maybe i might use it
so its called wow
i go to jacob with twentyfive thou you go with  hundred wow
i got eleven plaques on my walls right now
dont bite that chorus i might still use it
i aint gonna front its kinda hot
like they still werent looking at me like a rapper
and im sure dame figured like man if he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album you know
so uh dame took me into the office and hes like yo man b b you dont want a brick you dont want a brick
you gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on
i told hip hop and hip hop was all oh word
actually even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with h
that you know cause i told him i was gonna do it and im a man of my word i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do
then you know im not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a producer rapper and told h that told the heads of the capitol and right
the day im talking about i planned out everything i was gonna do man i had picked out clothes
i already started booking studio sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man i was ready to go
and they had mel call me they said yo
capitol pulled on the deal
and you know i told them that rocafella was interested
and i dont know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever
i went up
i called g i said man you think we could still get that deal with rocafella

my homie marley used to stay th and may
one of my best friends from back in the day
down the street from calumet a school for the stones
he nicknamed me krock so they would leave me alone
bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
and walked around the mall with his radio face off
plus he had the spinner from his daytons in his hand
keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
back when we rocked ellesses he had dreams of caprices
drove by the teachers even more by polices
howd he get the cash the day his father passed away
left him with a little somethin sixteen he was stuntin
hit lake shore girls go all crazy
hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
boned so much that summer even had him a baby
see backback thenthen if you had a car
you was the chitown version of baby
and i was just a virgin a baby
one of the reasons i looked up to him crazy
i used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked

you never know homie might meet some hoes homie

trunk open screens on neons lit with fifth relaxed
im on a mission for dimepieces and sexy ladies
allow me to introduce you to my cl mercedes
its a starstudded event when i valet park
open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
you see them fours crawling you see them screens falling
the disco ball in my mouth insinuates im ballin
im leaning on the switch sitting crooked in my slab
but i could still catch boppers if i drove a cab
a young houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
ridin something candy coated crawling like a caterpillar
im tipping on them fours im jamming on that screw
im looking for them hoes baby what it do drive slow homie

they say home is where the hate is my dome is where fate is
i stroll where souls get lost like vegas
seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
pray to god that my arms reach the masses
the young smoke grass in grassless jungles
rubber band together in cashless bundles
we wear strugglin chains divided only hustle remains
makin sense of it we hustle for change
revolution aint a game its another name for life fightin
someone to stay in they corner like mike tyson
hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
dont he know he could only get as high as he fell
show money becomes bail relationships become jail
children are unheld i wish love was for sale
behold the pale horse got me trapped like r kell i bail and it

might not be such a bad idea if i never never went home again
im on my way home
i left three days ago but no one seems to know im gone
home is where the hatred is
home is filled with pain and it
might not be such a bad idea if i never never went home again

yeah i mean the killers

i wonder whats in store for me
lately been stressing pray for blessings hope that theres more for me

nggas that i used to hoop with is doing triple life
gave up the jump shot

like insomniacs
this life can make a ngga fold like a laundry mat
i sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain
and so that i react slow in this fast world

slow nggas fast girls
hoes give up ass while these ho nggas hold triggers
blast on em
hold up that old checker flag for em

like it was draft day
swore that we would make the league be rich
watch how they pile up
seem like a mile up
i was the blisters on my hand than i dial up my best friend
and if a ngga disrespect yes we ready to fight
cause life was all about your name
you had to scrap with any ngga that would call you lame
ashamed no doubt so many nggas go they brains blown out
snatched a ngga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries
another body in a cemetery
another young ngga in the penetentiary
and he dont give a fck no missionary
rap visionary paint a picture ngga pictionary

went hard like the rent do
and he stay on with that thriller

the other day seen this girl walk by the other way
i would have spoke but when i looked at her she looked the other way
had it been another day i would have grabbed her by the hand
you dont know who i am but see i love the way you smile
do you got a man id be honored if i can walk with you for a second
i said if you aint got no plans
im trying to get to know you cause youre the type i go to
the type i write a song and make a beat about and flow to
anything to show you how beautiful you are
but you dont know it yet
maybe ill approach you next time and let you know exactly how i feel about you
until then i think of how fly it would be if it were her and i
the apple of my urban eye
and next time no lie i guess ill try cause i

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

it was one week later when i peeped her at the bus stop
laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
i walked over but i still couldnt do it
it was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
see fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
and im never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
they leave wounds and they scab and they pus
just when i was thinking that i look up and seen the bus
come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
thats when i could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
i put my eightyfive cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
and i was extra sure until somebody sat first
damn i guess my story got to wait until next verse

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

it was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of july
but she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
so this my opportunity to try and get at her
is it cool if i sit and then a smile was her reply
i sat down and started talking to her
be careful of what i say cause i aint want to sound awkward to her
said i been peeping you but i aint never spoke
and i figured if i try i probably choke
then she laughed and looked at me acting like i told a joke
and said joke for what lighten up real talk i been trying
and plus i always see you with him and she laughed again
but what she said next took me for a spin

i saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
to wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
forbidden juices had me so weak

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

show you how i feel if you let me in just for a minute
give you some compliments you cute
and introduce myself ya let me in just for a minute
and introduce myself ya let me in just for a minute

i know everything you like
so baby wont you let me in
and give you everything you wishin
so girl just give it a try
all i need is a minute baby

see now i aint bein fast
i just wanna talk with you
no pressure let me walk around the block with you
trying to think the kind of future we could walk into
and make you see all of the types of things i could offer you
a lifestyle that includes the things that a baller do
put you in the wifey spot i do it all for you
and start to do all these things that i dont often do
you see i hold my future wifey so im broken too
and as some time pass i prove that id be right for you
and i aint gamin leaving no plays or audibles
do what i oughta do but momma wont approve
cause she heard i be in the streets
like jwalkers do
just stop and think ma
dont miss an opportunity
just listen what you do to me
and everything you do ma you do it beautifully
call me selfish cause all i want is you with me


last week i had a thought im  years
thats old enough to start imagining and plenty fears
or will i go cause i dont fit in here with any peers
know theres more to life than smokin weed and drinkin many beers
and partyin but what else to do
when needin a lord of fame isnt helping you
wish i could tell jayz i see myself in you
i started with a dream and now im tryna be wealthy too
but its tough when your balancin it all
and walkin down a tight rope you balance bought to fall
the labels keep tellin me im talented and all
but i need another candy girl to really have it all
im hungrier than ever for a check
and plus my situations not at all what youd expect
i work my ass off im always stickin out my neck
cause they say the real currency aint cash but respect
but if you have one without the other
i hate bein broke but havin all the fame
and not havin to deal and have to be the blame
i wanna win bread and bring it home so after all we can live right
and give half of it to mom just to get right
and just to prove to her i know she wasnt psycho
for always supportin this dream she was right though
but its tough when lifes as stormy as the weather
and her health isnt gettin any better
and everydays a struggle the most recent trouble was her job
she caught me cryin told me she was laid off god
but she told me keep my spirits up high
she workin ill just keep on pushin aimin for the sky
and people wonder why i spend everyday high
cause my life isnt how its supposed to be but i try
keep feelin that im livin life wrong
but then i stop trippin as soon as i hit the bong
i go out to the club pretend my problems all gone
i see chicks at my shows know the words to my songs
my new girl told me g please promise me
if we gon be together you gon have to give me honesty
and honestly im tryin baby listen
im tryna do the best that i can for you
i feel that you deserve that and i care for you
cause while a groupie might love you when your big
soon as the fame goes they aint there for you real
a rappers girlfriend best spot for a wife
and this is just to give a snap shot of my life
for all you haters gossipin and speakin all freely
feelin like you know me cause you listen to my cd
because im in the lime light you can go and start
this is just to tell you what the business is this is it
this is it yeah im sick of it
if i aint care i swear id probably be fine

damn

and thats real

this is me

they fly me put me in a hotel and dine me

sitting back in the chair
thinking about the last time
the words were put on temporary delay
so what the hell was i supposed to say
you walked away

i tried to not think about it at all
tossed and turned in my sleep
until your vision was gone
with a few drinks and a couple of tears
i should be over this in just a couple of years
addicted to the feeling of being a crush
maybe ill just drive cause it gives me a rush
i cant slow it down so i crash and burn
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you without you
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic i need you i feel you

doctor doctor please prescribe me a prescription
some antiseptics for my affliction
its getting worse ive got a terrible condition
but its what happens when youre dealing with addiction
see im missing my love
i miss what it was the kisses and hugs
yo the way im missing her got me thinking its drugs
like cupid upgraded from arrows to slugs

i tried not thinking about it at all
tossed and turned in my sleep till your vision was gone
with a few drinks and a couple of tears
i should be over this in just a couple of years
addicted to the feeling of being a crush
maybe ill just drive cause it gives me a rush
i cant slow it down so i crash and burn
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you without you
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic i need you i feel you
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you without you
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you without you

look i need to go to rehab
for what we had
and i admit i never expected it to be bad
but losing you got me falling like my knees bad
she keep asking me how i can be mad
i let her go in the first place
had to do it
stupid but youve always been the first face
i keep in mind when i rhyme and write songs
missing all your lingerie and tight thongs
just a little nasty but always kept it classy
flashy but humble enough to still attract me
and i still keep your picture in my wallet
call it what you call it
im a damn loveaholic

i tried not thinking about it at all
tossed and turned in my sleep till your vision was gone
with a few drinks and a couple of tears
i should be over this in just a couple of years
addicted to the feeling of being a crush
maybe ill just drive cause it gives me a rush
i cant slow it down so i crash and burn
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you without you
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic i need you i feel you

oh try not to think about it all
the butterflies inside will eventually fall
try not to think about it now
i will find someone just tell me how

they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you without you
they call me a loveaholic
i dont feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic i need you i feel you

these girls wanna tie a kid down and keep me around
but i would never change im a dog im a hound
but i told them what they wanna hear
they like how it sounds
tell them im gone with the wind and im lost never found
i met her at my show then we smashed right after
if we go three rounds then shell fall in love faster
the very next morning im casper
in another city for a show somewhere getting plastered
its a disaster to her im a drug
i do her kinda dirt but they still fall in love
and i dont understand it
foreign chicks on me
and she speak another language like she from a different planet
she struggle when im gone
its hard when i leave
being ricky pen wear my heart on my sleeve
and she tell me that she love me but its hard to believe
cause im coming and going then i cum then i leave
and i swear im really not that shady
but you cant blame me for who ive met lately
nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
but i do play along yo i cant front
i give in to every groupie with a fat butt
london to japan
hong kong to iran
chicks say im the man


and everywhere i go these girls in my ear
and everywhere i go these girls in my ear
and everywhere i go these girls in my ear
and everywhere i go these girls in my ear


the other day seen this girl walk by the other way
i would have spoke but when i looked at her she looked the other way
had it been another day i would have grabbed her by the hand
you dont know who i am but see i love the way you smile
do you got a man id be honored if i can walk with you for a second
i said if you aint got no plans
im trying to get to know you cause youre the type i go to
the type i write a song and make a beat about and flow to
anything to show you how beautiful you are
but you dont know it yet
maybe ill approach you next time and let you know exactly how i feel about you
until then i think of how fly it would be if it were her and i
the apple of my urban eye
and next time no lie i guess ill try cause i

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

it was one week later when i peeped her at the bus stop
laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
i walked over but i still couldnt do it
it was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
see fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
and im never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
they leave wounds and they scab and they pus
just when i was thinking that i look up and seen the bus
come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
thats when i could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
i put my eightyfive cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
and i was extra sure until somebody sat first
damn i guess my story got to wait until next verse

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

it was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of july
but she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
so this my opportunity to try and get at her
is it cool if i sit and then a smile was her reply
i sat down and started talking to her
be careful of what i say cause i aint want to sound awkward to her
said i been peeping you but i aint never spoke
and i figured if i try i probably choke
then she laughed and looked at me acting like i told a joke
and said joke for what lighten up real talk i been trying
and plus i always see you with him and she laughed again
but what she said next took me for a spin

i saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
to wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
forbidden juices had me so weak

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy id talk to you when you walk by



uh this wasnt typical for me dont confuse it
only thing ive ever loved before you was music
i guess you never know what you have till you lose it
i know soon youll probably see it all clear
and realize you lost a real love
who was here for you unconditionally but its ugly
now years down the line you reminisce to the point you shed a tear
but ill be long gone and i never will appear in youre life no more
so gimme bout a year turn on the radio and ill be all that you can hear
and youll be mad you ever went and let me disappear
now its only my dreams that i run to
it just sucks that one of them will never come true
you cocked back and shot me down witchya gun boo
and i still got the wounds thatll prove it
took the energy thats what i go into the booth with
now i write a song from my heart you abuse it
and paint the picture of a love lost
now i know i cant afford the price love cost
feelin feeble and weak from the blood loss seeping from my chest
now i know it just aint what it once was


and since you peaced every day has been a struggle to
maintain sane when i know im still in love with you
and i know im buggin too wishin i could let it go and stop thinkin bout you
but i cant forget it though
somebody please pinch me i just gotta wake up
i just keep missin how it was before the break up
stuck in the past when you were my ace
i just hope you know you could never be replaced
it burns like mace in my face a vodka shot straight no chase when i think of us being erased
but you dont feel the same showin no empathy
aha ha it is what it is take it how you want it

this is pure skill far from damned luck
you gotta make a plan to never give your man up
and man up to positively stand up

we earn stripes you all hype in that propaganda
gats spot you cats shot but not from cameras

seems that youre runnin around
and i dont know what to do
cause i feel like youre lyin to me when im askin you

sometime you feel like you talkin through me
thats when you walk up to me
trying for attention

always got a show or in the studio doin a new song
them other dudes couldnt walk with my shoes on
still i come home hearin bout what i do wrong
pullin stunts and
rollin blunts
with my dudes from the hood
but to you they no good
im just doin what i could
and thats givin the circumstances
you only get one shot at these certain chances
instead of trying to find dirt
and where your manners
try and understand when that work demanded
and no mama thats not a punch line
im always there when its crunch time
but still you say


everytime you get mad when i ask you what you do what you do
seems that youre runnin around
and i dont know what to do
cause i feel like youre lyin to me when im askin you
sometimes

now i know you hear the he say she say
your home girls got my every move on replay
and the games that we play
but all the while ive been grindin for this weeks pay
hustlin each day in order to eat right
call me sayin she need me in order to sleep right
not really knowin what these streets like
so you stay up until i come back
help me relax
warm plate an the dub sack
and after that proceed the bend the back
then im back to politics the usual
and sometimes i wanna talk to get through to you
but damn

sometimes i dont know if youre tellin the truth
everytime you get mad when i ask you what you do what you do
seems that youre runnin around
and i dont know what to do
cause i feel like youre lyin to me when im askin you
sometimes

a prospect with his mind set on what to be
alot of chronic smoke  yunq broad come puff wit me
still i stay humble
focussed on my hustle
later forgettin it but everything got doubled

yeah i dodged the hood

slums came up out that

rap game about that

to gain pay wit out crack

see imma youngin wit too much on my plate

to let some small change have a youngin dumped in a cage



and take lives they worries aint jail

wit no regards for life cause they livin aint well

but me i dont do much just keep to myself


i was told the worlds cold but i see for my self

and im too hot to take the back seat or the shelf

so im here

for sum reason though they hate it to death

the loves gone only hatred is left

only achin and stress

a king not be mistaken for less

and this here is for the taking

cause the hates from most of your own people

theyre fake and theyre all see through

wonder when it gonna be my time

to meet death

and unless one of yall try to see whats mine

then ill eat through your flesh bones and leave that spine

u see i did the right thing

i stayed up out the gun and knife game

i knew about the pain it might bring

and we all got problems

i chose to smoke blunts just to drown em

the top but i rose from the bottom

and im here now

aint no body harming young

my screws loose they say somethings wrong wit young

ya times up im just warning young

cause this heres for the taking

this is history in the making

with no ink  i get it

im tryna stuff em until i cant fit no more
im talking donald trump level
im trying to get these dreams off the ground
all the hoes screaming ho

whoa the sky never seemed so low
looking at her like you never seemed so close
i had a dream about a trillion in cash
its time to make it happen
im back to dreaming what you cant imagine
talking cash you aint got to fake an accent
ive broke enough tree down that i couldmake a cabin
all my ones that i have is then divided by half
pass it on to my man write my will out then
pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
i had a dream i was greatest of all time
greatest of all bigs greatest of all seans
the warmer the weather the colder the drink
the colder the weather the warmer the mink
with no ink  i get it



sometimes i dream bigger than i live
sometimes i think better when im lit
so goin and light it
roll it up ignite it
i swear ive been through everything in life but a coffin
and my middle name michael ho
success is my idol and being broke is my rival
but its cool because i got the title ho

reflect on everything we missed
cause you know well never get it back

are you willing to give up what you love for who you love
or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
everywhere i go i get a group of hugs
thats what happens when they need connections and you the plug
how many trends you gotta set till you considered great
how many missed calls till you considered fake
how many dreams till its considered fate
im eating in a world where im considered bait
a workaholic addicted to bills
people addicted to me cause they addicted to real
my best friend got addicted to pills
i aint trying to rock no shirts that say in memory
im praying that he make wishing we could go back
cause honestly all the times that we had
those be the best memories

lets reminisce over the good times and the bad
reflect on everything we missed
cause you know well never get it back

sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
was mailed one when i heard nique had died in that crash
seemed like yesterday i just seen him smile and laugh
when i should be happy i can
they say my music beating cause i follow my heart
i always have faith like who swallows the darts
and with my mama looking at cribs that we cant purchase
houses bigger than a palace
but she a queen so she deserve it
so im focused they try to throw me off track
but they just hurdles
im marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
man im huddled up with my team in other words my inner circle
fast forward a few years later
remember the first time i was rhyming for kan
almost as nervous as the first time i rhymed for my mom
sold out the theater downtown she said it was perfect
but i already dreamed it
so it felt like i rehearsed it
much as my grandma took care of me since i was birthed
sad i used to steal twenty dollar bills right out her purses
no i aint perfect tryna make a gift out of a curse
life out of a hearse
and if i die of course i have the memories

lets reminisce over the good times and the bad
reflect on everything we missed
cause you know well never get it back

colombian necktie over hospital gown white

i live in a condo in the trees
the airs a little thinner that i breathe
iron man audi let the top strip tease

coming from a city where bullets turn bros into souls
who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
good girls stopped being good when i turned em into hoes
annotate dreams stopped being dreams when i turned em into goals
big was the first one that had it
then i saw nas chain man that was illmatic
then i saw kanyes hanging from his gold necklace
then ye gave me mine that show you my work ethic
mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
used to pick me up from school right after work
now she rolling up in that caddy like she coming to church
shes ask why i rock all this gold cause im coming in first
got the streets behind me like i was staring in the rearview
used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
now im in the penthouse look what a mill do
looking in the mirror and im still you im still you

got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

big was the first one that had it
now jacob the jeweler benefit from my habits
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

whats the noise all about with this rap stuff
i can say i never been punked robbed or smacked up
i can say i never been chased jumped or backed up
cause its a mental game i learned that when i got my first initial chain
i didnt fake it it was gold plated i was posing relatin
to those dealing with blow had the big gold bold anchors it was those gangsters
that bonus that culture those projects
they got in my bones now im coppin stones
sorry sierra leone one day well right the wrongs
 karat gold cuban on not too short not too wide not too long
my pendant offensive in the truest form
platinum gold rose gold what you want

got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

big was the first one that had it
then i saw nas chain man that was illmatic
and i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

on a highway to heaven look at all the tolls i paid
i done gave my city drive all the roads i paved
no matter what way i turn things go my way
im rocking chains everyday so you know i slave
look up in the mirror chain only thing lyin
no heroes where im from bullets only thing flying
i know the higher that i go the harder to climb
but after that the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
police only work hour shifts
trap house built brick by brick paid dues on dues
ff good you know im reppin crew on crews
stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
girls on girls lingerie and moulin rouge
god damn i think im gon od
off this asparagus and bread and pasta
need a doctor ive been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
its like i got a builtin doppler
i dont remember my first love or my first time prayin
but remember my first ass and the first time she came
it almost felt as good as when i got my first chain

got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

jayz taught me money aint a thing
came from the streets headed to the hall of fame
stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

its such a wonderful thing to see the end of all things
i got my mind is on me a couple others and dreams
about two months in a weeks time
went from feelin hellish to godly with lemonlime shine
see this piece that i own now how sick is the rope
taking life for what it is the troublesome chick
who throws fists sometimes its the weather
things switch up people trip up
the money come down then climb up but when it come again
the most creepin deceivin men are schemeschemin
saying that you love me i surely hope and if you dont
it might be too late but the songs will live on
just know this fact you were all wrong
now watch me do my silly dance not really a dance
more like a prance  im signing off with a crotch grab

thank you man for letting me get on this record sean

ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz

ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz

move to the neighborhood i bet they dont stay for good watch
somebodyll steal daddys rollie and call it the neighborhood watch
pray for a safer hood when my paper good watch
captain save the hood hood savior baby boy

still get idd for swishers
mama still wash my clothes
still with save money militia
im a still watch my bros

trapped in the middle of the map with a little bitty rock
and a little bit of rap
and like literally jack

ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz

ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz

they merking kids they murder kids here
why you think they dont talk about it they deserted us here
somebody get katie couric in here
probably scared of all the refugees

they be shooting whether its dark or not
i mean the days is pretty dark a lot
down here its easier to find a gun

no love for the opposition
specifically a cop position
cause theyve never been in our position
getting violations for the nation correlating you dry snitching

ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz

ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz

i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared too
i know you scared
me too

i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared too
if you was there
then we just knew youd care too

it just got warm out
i hope that it storm in the morning
i hope that its pouring out

i hate crowded beaches
i hate the sound of fireworks
and i ponder whats worse
between knowing its over and dying first

cause everybody dies in the summer
wanna say ya goodbyes tell them while its spring
i heard everybodys dying in the summer
so pray to god for a little more spring

i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared too
if you was there
then we just knew youd care too

whats better than tripping is falling in love
whats better than letterman leno fallon and all the above
whats better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
is the first caveman pops with his son ball and a club

whats better than paper is balling it up
whats better than followers is actually falling in love
whats better than frolicking follies fallin in mud
rolling in green pastures wandering following love

whats better than eating is feeding your fam
whats better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
whats better than leaning and needing your xan
is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land

whats better than yelling is hollering love
whats better than rhymes nickles dimes and dollars and dubs
is dialing up your darling just for calling her up
there aint nothing better than falling in love

ive seen it come back back back and forth
you hit the nail right on top of the head
i know you seen it all before
but when it looks you in the eyes
it aint nothing you could say but thats love

thats love
thats love
thats love
say thats love
thats love
thats love thats love thats love

kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
the richest man rocks the snatchless necklace

wore my feelings on my sleeveless
my weed seedless my trees leafless
i miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
and back when mike jackson was still jesus

before i believed in not believing in
yeah i inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
my big homie died young just turned older than him

i seen it happen i seen it happen i see it always
he still be screaming i see his demons in empty hallways
i trip to make the fall shorter
fall quarter was just a tall order

and im hungry im just not that thirsty
as of late my verses seem not so versey
and all my words just mean controversy
took the team up off my back like thats not your jersey

stressin pullin my hair out hoping i dont get picked
all this medicine in me hoping i dont get sick
making all this money hoping i dont get rich

sometimes the truth dont rhyme
sometime the lies get millions of views
funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
from your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view

i think love is beautiful too
building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
for future hoopers dead from rugers shooting through the empty alley
couldve threw him an alleyoop helping him do good in school

damn that acid burn when it clean ya
i still miss being a senior
and performing at all those open mic events
high schools eyes closed seeing arenas

and i still get jealous of vic
and vic still jealous of me
but if you touch my brother
and the rest of your team

smoking cigarettes to look cooler
i only stop by to look through ya
and im only getting greedier
and im still mr youmedia

and i still cant find talent
mom still thinks i should go back to school
and justin still think im good enough

and mama jan still dont take her meds
and i still be asking god to show his face
and i still be asking god to show his face

i am a new man i am sanctified
oh i am holy i have been baptized
i have been born again i am the white light
rain rain dont go away


uh it definitely be mad important
ay man that sound like a prince song

still a chain smoking name dropping
mother shut your mouth

still a chain smoking name dropping
mother shut your mouth
brain broken frank ocean listening
stain hitting satin woodgrain gripping
paint dripping mother shut your mouth

somebody pray for the god oh lord i wonder what michaels on
shoulda died yelling yolo was a lie and you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
you and i look just alike and im afraid that this one right here might be last time that i write a song
so i aint tryna go out at all got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
last chance joint gotta be a dance joint from an introspective drugged out standpoint
throw bands joint wanna hold hands joint old school for my own old man joint

still a chain smoking name dropping
mother shut your mouth
brain broken frank ocean listening
stain hitting satin woodgrain gripping
paint dripping mother shut your mouth

i play this so loud in the car i forget to park my whip

thats why i pray to the dealer god know who he be
truth be told he juiced me introduced me to the lucy leaf

still a chain smoking name dropping
mother shut your mouth
brain broken frank ocean listening
stain hitting satin woodgrain gripping
paint dripping mother shut your mouth

im feeling shortness of breath so nico grab you a horn
hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter

that even jericho walls must fall
every wall must fall

with the faith of a pumpkinseedsized mustard seed
here for i will speak noble things as they trusted me
only righteous i might just shrug at the skullduggery

exalt exalt glorify
descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
i used to hide from god
ducked down in the slums like shhh

i was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa
no hog no meerkat hakuna matata by day
i prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
or so it seemed
a mustard seed was all i needed to sow a dream
i build the ark gently gently i rowed my boat down noahs stream
sometimes the path i took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
i was so far down in the mud couldnt even let my light shine
but she was always there when i needed to phone a friend or use a life line
from a lofty height wage won
the poltergeist to exalt the christ
spark the dark with the pulse of light
strike a corpse with a pulse of life

cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
poison the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs

are jagged for giving that pain to his city in gold

just in case an atom bomb comes falling on my lawn

we are all mortals arent we any moment this could go
cry cry cry even though that wont change a thing
but you should know you should hear that i have loved
i have loved the good times here and i will miss our good times here

i believe jehovah jireh
i believe theres heaven i believe in war
i believe a womans temple
gives her the right to choose but baby dont abort
i believe that marriage isnt
between a man and woman but between love and love
and i believe you when you say that youve lost all faith
but you must believe in something something something
you gotta believe in something something something

i still believe in man
a wise one asked me why
cause i just dont believe were wicked
i know that we sin but i do believe we try
we all try the girls try the boys try
women try men try you and i try try we all try

i dont believe in time travel
i dont believe our nations flag is on the moon
i dont believe our lives are simple
and i dont believe theyre short this is interlude
i dont believe my hands are cleanly
cant believe that you would let me touch your heart
she didnt believe me when i said that i lost my faith
you must believe in something something something
you gotta believe in something something something

i still believe in man
a wise one asked me why
cause i just dont believe were wicked
i know that we sin but i do believe we try

this is the home of the brave land of the free
but your parents still didnt know

do what you have to
i do what i had to
to break through a pick a style that sticks like glue
and as i rank i wanna thank no one
you helped me around
my parents put me down
i never skipped town
i stood my ground
we kept showin up
drinkin and throwin up
rap was my life
as i was growin up
actin a fool in school no one topped us
smart ass in class at times abnoxious
drivin a bronco
runnin my own show
and pullin the look a like marilyn monroe hoes
and me and bo got together
made sense
i scratched records and performed a few tricks
pumpin the new sounds town to town
who holds it down like bad leroy brown
now i wont stop cause yo im kid rock
the genuine article

they dont want me

fffames a costin the price aint nice
its like the roll of the dice
for a whole new life
but dont get my song wrong
i enjoy it alot
walkin around like a big shot
cause im kid rock
smooth as an ice cube
cool as an igloo
and more complex than a rubix cube
a healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue
smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run
and as i incline through time to get mine
i try not to slide but walk a straight line
though its hard when the climb gets steep
the one who finds is the one who seeks
so i sought and fought
and alot i got taught
and although i left those who stole got caught
many shows i rocked
many suckers i laughed at
and those who snapped back usually got slapped
the cat if i was strap
cause i was a sun of a gun
livin life on the run
now i pleaded  and outdone by none
bold young handsome bad like bronson
pumpin the new sounds town to town
and when in motown i cool out in greektown
on the upside with nothin too high
the genuine article

they dont want me
chuck nice break that beat down
uh huh uh huh uh huh
kdc huh

six generations of rap and im first
ready to burst the style is rehearsed
i worked and worked and worked and i worked
when many thought i was just gettin jerked
used abused but i paid my dues
and now no one out there could fill my shoes
and my pants and do this dance
it went slow not quick but now im your pick
aint that a trip when i started from zip
and now up and up and up i wont stop
the flop just pop the flat top the kid rock
yes me the low key mc
with the ability to rock a party
anywhere and make people stare
im lookin while im cookin with no care
pumpin the new sound town to town
who holds it down like bad leroy brown
and still i wont stop growin this flat top
the genuine article

they dont want me


everything i do gonna be funny

new player on the field so yield and get back
to the wall
cause im playin ya all
like a game
kid is the name
some complain
and they got a little fame
and its a shame
for what its worth
im down with earth
pourin it on like ms butterworth
rich and thick
kinda quick not slow
the rhymes i fit into flow
all in a row from the intro
to the end so ho
put down the microphone and go
step a side as i make room to bloom
any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb
as soon as i grip the mic to get loose
dont dispute cause ya got no juice
meanwhile i kick a rhyme from the pile


get down on your knees and pray when i break you
down with a sound
comin down with a pound
or a bang
if you cant hang with the slang
that i exploit
comin straight from detroit
rough without a doubt or a question
kid rock here in the flesh
and addressin and defining certain issues
so wipe the tears from your eyes
you cant hide so dont be surprised
when i dismiss you from your throne
and send you home
as a kid rock clone
cause i can hold my own
like ya hold a milkbone
simple as this with a grip that wont quit
so when i hit the skit
thats it
so dont come in face with the base
and remember your just an imitation
dont get buckwhile
in fact dont smile
cause ill pull your file

ill claim the boundries of my domain
detroit detroit
fresh im from the midwest
from motown from motown

im like steel or concrete yo cause im the hardest
down with a label known to be the largest
not bein modest dont even think of tryin to hang
cause yo kid rock rolls like a stop o
i roll thick
i roll heavy
dnice justs keeps the pace steady
so get ready to feel the pain
im kid rock drivin girls insane
so listen rappers and get to the program
breakin ya down is the kid rock slogan
and any rapper who thinks about dissin
you know what ill say
i got a great big dick
so anyone who cant adjust
gets rust
and then bites the dust
be ready to walk a mile
cause ill smack that koolaid smile


burnin
oh no oh no here we go now

see a fly skinny on the avenue
my shades down hat flipped on and on a cashew
could not believe my eyes so i lifted up my shades
and this girl is starring at me as if she wanted to get laid
next the girl started steppin and she crossed the street
she walked to me and at that my knees got weak
then i snapped to realize that it was my duty
to get this freak and cowax the booty

wax that booty
cowax the booty
freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty
wax that booty
cowax the booty
i gotta freak freak so i am gonna wax her booty

heading for the crib i was reciting some rhymes
when the freak cut in and started telling of the times
she wanted to rock me and these were no lies
and that is when i contracted the rise in my levis
step into my crib she said the rise impressed her
so without delay i began to undress her
unstrapped her bra and whispered to her are you with me
she said yes so i grabbed them titties
next was the test to see if she was high rank
i dropped her panties and was slippin i asked do you stank
she said no and noted to me that her shower soap is gucci
so i dropped my boxers and headed for her coochie
headed fo her coochie
grease it down real good
headed for her coochie
dang thats good

now when i got to her coochie i looked close to see
if this girl had any types of signs of vd
she did not so i said to myself oh goody
and i grabbed my dick and costuck in her puddy
started rocking this freak with my hands on her butt
you should have seen in her booty i was tearin it up
next i whispered in her ear baby please turn over
and rocked doggie style while i was calling her rover
still tearin it up on her face was a grin
holdin on to her waist pumping harder than sin
but she was lovin it all with her back in a arch
i busted my nut and she started to bark
arf arf arf
uh
arf arf arf
uh
arf arf arf
na na bop but nop but

now if you think the story is over just listen to this
i thought my mission was complete so i gave her a kiss
then i was searchin for a towel to clean off my dickie
cause it was kinda wet all bloody and sticky
and to talk about gross heres something sicker than sick
i started trippin cause this was something ive never seen
the girl was more than a freak she was a sexual fiend
and when i thought that was as gross as one girl could get
she stuck her finger in her booty and then she licked it
oh now this girl was much more to me than a freak
in my opinion she was plain nasty
but never the less i completed my duty
i got this freak and cowaxed the booty

wax that booty
cowax the booty
i got the freak and i waxed her booty
i love the booty you love the booty
hey freak come here and let me wax your booty

appeal the feel but dont praise and kneel
just heal
and always look for the seal thats real
top dog lookin up to say what is this
kid rock serious and i mean business
ascending up and up i keep boosting
makin hit records like whitney houston
with a mind of violence right i might
blow the show teachers speakin yo i cut mps
to release to each and be friends of
every single individual

everybody all over the world its time for understandin
come together

jumbo yo thats how im movin
im the new kid in heres what im givin
a jammed slammin command that take authority
cause too many mcs appear apsrt of me

but i keep the crowd swingin like tarzan
cause im a wise man here to teach and speak
so come with it kid rocks gonna get it
his style aint dope its a throat and i slit it
im raw like cowhide smooth like a plane ride
no half steppin i always take a full stride
who came played and they say im concrete made
i used to come correct in the projects
new port oxford deep in the basement
house and parties like real estate agent
so on so strong and everyone got along
knowledge is power and theres a point to this song

everybody all over the world its time for understandin
come together
everybody all over the world its time for understandin
come together

now as i said my prayers through the years i shed a few tears
cause its unjust when i see my peers get shot
and dropped and forgot now thats hot
too many cant score as victims of a drug war
cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out
the press finds out then the public is tripped out
new tax the acts and half the drug industry
uncle sam is my man are you kiddin me
for one to get over one must get stuck up
one will roll up another will smoke up
two more thrown in jail who picks the toll up
tell her to beware if shes gonna stand there
eyes bugged out and hands in the air
cause there comes an onlooker lookin for a hooker
and act like the doors overlooked her and took her
for a place to hide and when he got his ride
he let the nice slide and the girl she died
her family cried over this homicide
and why they pondered why she wandered
left her own spot her home her mom and pop
all to smoke a little cooked up rock
so on and so strong she couldnt get along
knowledge is power and theres a point to this song

everybody all over the world its time for understandin
come together
everybody all over the world its time for understandin
come together

from the outskirts with a mind like albert einstein
maybe im ahead of my time
imaginate create spectate elevate from the states
surrounded by the great lakes
i was once out cold at  years old
rolled and sold you me and bo
sittin in jackson infested with rats
with a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks
i was a young bad mother in my own eyes
but now i realize it wasnt too wise
so now i teach ill reach to each
and every single individual

everybody all over the world its time for understandin
come together
come together
come together
come come come come together


people like the way my style is rollin
the crowd rebounds as i flow slowin
heres how im hittin
funkin it up more than george clinton
swingin and bringin in a new format
a new breed indeed and im sure of that
ill impress the best i wont rest the best
cause im blessed and i just wont settle for less
yes the kid who gets the crowd up
the one with the hair that stands straight up
people look and stare in shock

trippin over a rock
trippin over a rock

chased and chased and chased but never close to caught
and the skills i filled were all self taught
with so many styles on each panfulls
and they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels
as the girls admire the way i aspire
to move higher and build my own empire
not a liar i tell no lies
so hey girl you can trust these blue eyes
but dont get me wrong i get wicked
shake that ass in my face and ill stick it
hit it get wit it
knock it out the box

trippin over a rock
trippin over a rock

a genuine badman
like yosemite sam man
i ccccan rock the land
and bring a new swing and sensation
to represent the next generation
so slack up you better back up
come the score and you leave in a jigsaw
with no doubt
ill put my foot in your ass and wont pull it out
ill go deep in i wont weaken
guarenteed to keep the house leapin
girls flockin guys
try to to cockblock

cause everybodys trippin over a rock


i had a realization of god i saw god and umm
its not a face or a figure or anything it was a presence
the universe everything you me were part of god
were part of god it was an incredible feeling
and to use acid is religious for me


kid rock thats right you know im back ho
from the dead where i had to lay low
seems strange but i aint changed nothing
in the flesh and i guess im the best
for the pimp in the pimp of the nation
all we need to learn is how to hold hands
then we could live in peace in my homeland
god damn the way my pain swells
i spend all my time killin brain cells
the light shed on me was a dim gleam
so i live life in a bottle of jim beam
droppin dots or sniffin that blow black
roll with zig zags like to read skin mags
when i shoot i never miss
and if i played the bass id probably pluck it like this
people wanna know what im thinkin but i dont care
so i keep my thoughts in a bottle of cuervo
just a wild young buck
cause i still be clownin suckers be frownin
forties of busch i be poundin
i aint dead in the head like manson
hanson brother style when im rumblin
couple of shots of don q and i be stumblin
fumblin footballs hangin in the pool halls
im not into havin clean fun
i step into the party strapped with a machine gun
but im no gangster like gotti
im just an mc to put the boogie in the party
back in black plus a new track
and i wont quit till your ears blow from feedback
when i shoot i never miss
and if i played the guitar id probably strum it like this
and today i know you dont wanna get shot
you look gay youre too cliche
your little plan was a flop
tryin to get em on by sellin out the kid rock
a part of me was with you but yo he died
and im glad you stepped off cause i aint givin no free rides
you little bald headed peon
cause im sure im sure ya
are gonna try to come back around but ill ignore ya
it only takes one shot to floor ya
better jet so cause i wont let no hoes from the metro
take mine what up doe
come look son im number one
in the twilight zone with rod serling
when i shoot i never miss
and if i played the harmonica id probably blow it like this


cause growin up i was never
the logical one
like the prodigal son
with a bottle of jack
and my shotgun strapped
i went looking for fame
and yo ive never been back

filled with spite
staying high as a kite
i was dealing and stealing
everything in sight
pool hustling
trying to make that green
ive been ramblin and gamblin
since the age of 

like a god damn tank
some disagree because
my rents had bank
but all thats gold
dont always glitter
so ill take another puff
from my one hitter

im a slave to the trade
im paid to rhyme
blow all my cash
on cheap women and wine
cause money money money
but i gotta make a lot
just to be free

im here and im there
im here and im there
im kid rock ho and im everywhere

i hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
she holds in that morning time and never lets me go
i hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

please god please
ill pay any cost
if youd just stop the world
cause i wanna get off
theres too much hardship
theres too much pain
tryin to get in my brain

ive been to your mountains
ive been to your seaside
and everywhere i went
somebodys wanted a free ride
but parasites cant fake the rock
and any suckers that step in my way are getting shot

cause i hold key
to my own success
and suckers that step
shall be put to rest
i hold the key
to my own success
and suckers that step
will catch a bullet in their chest

so pass the buddha
the funky tie hooter
and watch me rip
because im such a slick shooter
not a generic dime
adozen mc
never was in a posse
never wanted to be

im here and im there
im here and im there
im kid rock ho and im everywhere

i hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
she holds in that morning time and never lets me go
i hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

now ive been walking the earth
since the beginning of time
and wont leave till
ive received that th sign
all this talk
their gonna drop the bomb
but life keeps going
on and on and on and on

the worlds end
dont worry me
and im gonna get where im going
just dont hurry me
cause im in no rush
and i cant stand rushin
everything is slow motion
like im trippin on tussin

fussin with the girls
they waste my time
thrashin and bashin
going out of my mind
crucified by the critics
everyday
cause i really aint got
that much to say

im a slave to the trade
im paid to rhyme
i dont wear a watch
and i dont keep time
i live my life
just like the skipper
because im a day tripper

twitchin shakin
and i get more bass
then john paul jones
visions of red shoot through my head
and i wont stop trippin
till the day im dead

im here and im there
im here and im there
im kid rock hoe and im everywhere

i hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
she holds in that morning time and never lets me go
i hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

thinks that hes a camper
known around my way as the cramper

but he wont go away with a little motrin
now if you ever heard the term cramper and you wonder
the worms kinda like i guess a modern day felix unger
when ya first meet em ya think hes ok

but then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way
he squawks and he gawks and he walks a thin line

he always wants to get high but never has a bag
never works says he cant find the right job
aint got a dime and when he does hes a tightwad
hes the dampest theres no one damp

now the crampers red theres no one redder
he rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater
hes sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer

you come home hes at your house drinkin your last beer
pokin and strokin he makes you want to belt him
and then sportys never that cautious

he sips from your forty and he always backwashes
talk about a certain subject hell jinx it
let him borrow a shirt the stooge always shrinks it
hes the dampest theres no one damper



i trip i rip and though i think im slick
im nothin but a funky country hick
but i still get down with a sound that pumps

in the carhart flannel and dusty jeans baby
i never was cool with james dean
but i be hanging tough with my man jim beam
i swing low like a chimp
back in  man i was seein a shrink
but now im humble and i can only think
about new orleans and those jumbo shrimp
so ask no questions and ill tell no lies
i got big ol pupils and blood shot eyes
im on the brink if you know what i mean
and a  step program couldnt keep me clean
cause im the bullgod you understand
the illegitimate son of man
the t o p to the d o g
or the p o t to the g o d

and im trippin
said im trippin

i am the bullgod
i am free
and i feed on all that is forsaken

a lot of people poke fun and thats all right
but when i start pokin back they get all uptight
you cant cap with the master son
so sit your ass down before i blast you one
cause im so greasy you can call me mud
and i feel a little hank runnin through my blood
i wanna flood the world with my twisted thoughts
you can bet all day but i cant be bought
uh break it up lets tie one on
i gotta get set to go and cut the lawn
so i grab my walkman but before i cut
i got behind the garage and fire it up
cause im the bullgod you understand

yeah yeah yeah yeah
come on get em up
come on get em up
come on get em up

i am the bullgod
i am free
i am free
and i feed on all that is

i get a feeling of peace from a low so high
as i sit in my chair and watch life go by
these thoughts i have cant mold to sense
through the forest of my mind theyre all past tense
born and raised in the outer lands
and at times you can say im outta hand
im in a band of gypsies were on the run
every time that paper hits my tongue
and sometimes it seems so odd
when my veins are popping and im on the nod
i am the bullgod you understand
and here in my head is my master plan

uh im gonna get you
i see through you
im gonna get you
i see through you


im not the trash you think i am talking trailor park
ill take you higher higher
ill take you lower slower
ill make you talk that talk and walk that walk hoe

i see you checkin out my car and my residence
your hell bound and i see your gettin whiskey bent
i been around and i know what you meant




i like that long hair swingin in them calvin klines



my six shooter strapped and im lookin for a battle
out on the plains im just a loner
my saddle horn rubs right and yo its givin me a boner
i got thoughts of annie oakley
but that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me
i gave my last gold tooth n gold nugget to get my dick sucked
 days out on the frontier
and id kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer
i need a slut for a service
i take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous
man i gotta get my rocks off
cause my wranglers dont fit right unless my cocks soft
didnt take any practice
a desperate rado
got a cock like a cactus
now i drift through the desert like a wild coyote
horny as a toad trippin off peyote
holdin uptrains and gettin goods by the sack
im known through out the west as the pie eyed mack
and to the law im no stranger
im wanted dead or alive cause i shot the lone ranger
and then tonto tried to get down
thats the way i run my show
paint towns red
i know you think im archaic
but my dicks like a sword
out on the plains it gets linely
sometimes i feel homely
new faces
new towns no one knows me
guns cocked in my holster
u see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster
im always lookin for the quick buck
some say my heads hollow
trottin through the bad lands
a desperate rado
tokin down with all the cowhands
a desperate rado
didnt take much practice
a desperate rado
got a cock like a cactus
in any town i can be found at the local bordello
never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin
and when im kickin dust you better circle up the wagons
so when i rip through your town dont be gawkin
just tip your hat and tex keep walkin
cause im a gun slingin top hand
im a low down buckaroo
cause im a sidewinding nomad
and morals in upbringing is something that i never had
known as the ruff ridin texan
a bad buck from the day of my inception
and i was raised in the poor house
my mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house
now since the day i left the corral
ive been on a quest for the plant thats called mescal
cause pale rider once pulled me aside
and told me that high was the best way to ride
always lookin for a fight
a desperate rado
puffin on a peace pipe
im a desperate rado
on the run from the law
a desperate rado baddest one you ever saw

i need somebody wont you help me
i need somebody wont you tell me who i am
ive been livin a lie so long it seems ive lived a life time
if you could see what i feel it would make your ghetto look like heaven
and i believe it stems down from my family situation
i never liked my old man
i couldnt stand to be around him
sometimes i sit all alone just starin at his picture yeah
my heart turns to stone and i think of this

i need somebody wont you help me
i need somebody wont you tell me who i am
you never loved me you never held me tight
you tried to make me think that your ways were best
when all i was was an outlet for all your stress

life its the ultimate sin
a game with no rules that youre expected to win
my personal hells hidden with a grin
dad take the stand and let the trial begin
you said that oil and water dont mix though it seems cool
uyoushouldve went to school like your bigger brother
but you played the fool with a different color
runnin ship with a whip
i tried to keep up but i kept getting tripped
money made you so wise
how could you look through my face and not see your own eyes
do as i say and not as i do
but i cant cause when i look in the mirror i see you
and oh the pain how it hurts
it was always your home and your business that came first
you said a man is as good as his word
but your mind was closed and mine never heard
my visions blurred thoughts obscured
and with my blinders down i strain from the heard
they say the nut dont fall far from the tree
look at you then look at me

you aint nothin to me youve never been to me
and its the day that i die of this hate that im free

now i know growin up son that it aint always been easy
and i know at times i was not always there for you
no we never spent much time just talkin or havin a good time
but understand growin up son i never had a dime
so i worked my ass off and i put myself through college
and everything i have to this day you know i built it all
oh i wish i could go back and change the years thats lost between us
i wish i could take back some of the things i said to you
son i said im sorry but still you resent me so
son i said im sorry and why do you resent me so

i always loved you i always cared for you
just never wanted you to go through what ive been through
and now im hated like the devil and for why i dont know
dah

all right get down baby
yeah

i need somebody wont you help me
i need somebody wont you tell me who i am
i need somebody please please help me
i need somebody you must tell me who i am

once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
there stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
he painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
and he didnt hear the fallin of the rain

in the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
and she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
she was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
cause she didnt mind the fallin of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall
ah but i dont want to know and i dont want to see
another rainy day without you lyin next to me

high upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
with his eyes on the ground his head is bowed he is a fool
and his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
but he will not see the fallin of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall
ah but i dont want to know and i dont want to see
another rainy day without you lyin next to me

so now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
but the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
and it seems that time has brought things to an end nothings changed
cause you cant stop the fallin rain


oh sweet lady runnin like a stream
you dont look back because you know your hands are clean
you make believe the past was just a dream
you make believe the past was just a dream

turn around turn around
and i will sing for you a song
i dont know where you been
but youve been gone too long

oh elisa you must begin again
and all the roads that you have walked are comin to an end
i was your lover but i thought i was your friend
i loved you but i thought i was your friend

turn around turn around
and i will sing for you a song
i dont know where you been
but youve been gone too long

oh sweet lady stand beside the sea
maybe you will find a little time to think of me
wont you please remember what i tried so hard to be
yeah remember what i tried so hard to be

so turn around turn around
and i will sing for you a song
and i dont know where you been
but youve been gone too long


ah you look so good to me
with my eyes open wide i can see
ah you feel so good to me
and its so good when youre here cause im free

feelin the glory from that smile upon your face
its liftin me high above my ordinary place
and i am so happy when im in your warm embrace

ah you look so good to me
with my eyes open wide i can see
ah you feel so good to me
and who knows what your next move will be

ah you look so good to me
with my eyes open wide i can see
ah you feel so good to me
and its so good when youre here cause im free


ive been livin for the moment
but i just cant have my way
and im afraid to go to sleep
cause tomorrow is today

people tell me life is sweeter
but i dont hear what they say
nothing comes to change my life
so tomorrow is today

i dont care to know the hour
cause its passing anyway
i dont have to see tomorrow
cause i saw it yesterday

so i listen for an answer
but the feeling seems to stay
and whats the use of always dreaming
if tomorrow is today

still im waiting for the morning
but it feels so far away
and you dont need the love im giving
so tomorrow is today

oh my goin to the river
gonna take a ride and the lord will deliver me
made my bed now im gonna lie in it
if you dont come im sure gonna die in it
too late too much given
ive seen a lot of life and im damn sick of livin it
i keep hopin that you will pass my way

and some day if your dreams are leavin you
ill still believe in you

i dont care to know the hour
cause its passing anyway
i dont have to see tomorrow
cause i saw it yesterday

though im living and im singing
and although my hands still play
soon enough it will all be over
cause tomorrow is today


well so here i am at the end of the road
where do i go from here
i always figured it would be like this
still nothing seems to be quite clear

all the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled
but i just cant decide where to go
yes its been quite a day and i should go to sleep
but tomorrow i will wake up and ill know

that ive got to begin again

once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
there stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
he painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
and he didnt hear the fallin of the rain

in the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
and she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
she was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
cause she didnt mind the fallin of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall
ah but i dont want to know and i dont want to see
another rainy day without you lyin next to me

high upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
with his eyes on the ground his head is bowed he is a fool
and his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
but he will not see the fallin of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall
ah but i dont want to know and i dont want to see
another rainy day without you lyin next to me

so now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
but the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
and it seems that time has brought things to an end nothings changed
cause you cant stop the fallin rain


hey lord take a look all around
and id afind where my babys gonna be
cause she is far across the sea

and make sure that shes gonna be alright
and things are gonna be alright with me

it must have been your funny face
it must have been your love

it must have been your love
it must have been your love i said

it must have been your love in a little bit
it must have been your love

it must have been your poppy eyes
that made me step outside
it must have been the sight of tears that
let me know i cried

it must have been your bunny shake
it must have been your love
a lot of girls wont come around they
treat me like a wolf

it must have been your love
it must have been your love i said
it must have been your love i gotta give it that
it must have been your love

youre my angel baby
youre my darling
youre my star
lololololita
let her see me deep in love

youre the reason why
youre the reason i

it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love

youre my angel baby
youre my darling
youre my star
lololololita
let her see me deep in love

lopsided eyes and a crooked frown
make more of life just settle down
every single little princess needs a crown
make more of life just settle down

it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love

bang on my window if
you want to get your look out
i felt the wind blow when
she took her little book out

im steady loving on the
lady of these pages
another chapter if you will
so advantageous

take off your glasses and fight

under the hula moon im
going to pop the culture
blue cherry dress on you
is looking like a sculpture

this recreation is amusing
and confusing
you never knew that it
could feel so good while losing

what you lose
your virginity

take off your glasses and fight

ill be your domino
sit back and watch it flow
get so emotional
i got a notion for
and when a star gets bent
ill be your parliament
ill be your domino
sit back and watch it flow

my intuition was a
poppin and a shakin
the very thought of it was
all too much to take in

curl up with lover we
could lie out on the blanket
this canopy above ill
take the time to thank it

take off your panties and fight

ill be your domino
sit back and watch it flow
get so emotional
i got a notion for
and when a star gets bent
ill be your parliament
ill be your domino
sit back and watch it flow

i want to bury my face
deep in your aroma
her name is lisa
but they call her desdemona

come out and see me for
some street communication
i think its sweet of you
to be my motivation

ill be your domino
sit back and watch it flow
get so emotional
i got a notion for
and when a star gets bent
ill be your parliament
ill be your domino
sit back and watch it flow


when i had you to myself
i didnt want you around
those pretty faces always seemed
to stand out in a crowd
but someone picked you from the bunch
one look was all it took
and now its much too late for me
to take a second look

oh baby give me one more chance to
show you i love you
wont you please let me
back in your heart
oh darlin i was blind to let you go
let you go baby
now since ive been true where its at
i want you back


burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch
burn it up no need to reconcile

come and see me im your west end perfect stranger in america
lady on that states so full of style

stand up turn around beat it out
you gotta sound joe
swing low and now i know
its hard to let a brother go joe

no one said that you would need a crowd

the many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
and now i only see your face in clouds

stand up turn around beat it out
you gotta sound joe
swing low and now i know
its hard to let a brother go joe

stand up turn around beat it out
you gotta sound joe
swing low and now i know
its hard to let a brother go joe

do you know
does it show
when im low

and then again when i feel your love from far away i think of yesterday
i see a family we know how to smile

there comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along
there comes a time when we will walk that mile

stand up turn around beat it out
you gotta sound joe
swing low and now i know
its hard to let a brother go joe

stand up turn around beat it out
you gotta sound joe
swing low and now i know
its hard to let a brother go joe


on the corner into my car
i drive forever never get far
the  is slowly getting loaded

california mountains in the mornin
stitch it up and get it all
all along the womans got a want it

we all walk your pavement get it off

whoa whoa whoa whoa

a pendulum inside of my bed
swingin low i hope to get hit

the big sleep without a bed of roses
the light of day will never tell lies

on the river into my dock
i paddle thought the shadow and fog
to ponder all of those who came before me
another piece for building my arch


lets make evil
lets make good
id do anything i could
just to get you in my dirty wood
go down on you

seventeen and thirtyone
i am just my mothers son
brown eyes and a silver tongue
all the mothers come undone
at the sight of me

the waters falling clear
interiors deceive i fear
i think ill kiss my shame away
my prudence is not dear
inside out and feeling weird
i think ill kiss my shame away

lets get soft
lets get hard
lets get off in my backyard
where the desert wind
will wash our skin
a lighter red

lets make peace
lets make war
lets break into heaven for
a dance with heavens devils or
is that more than you can store
inside your head

the waters falling clear
interiors deceive i fear
i think ill kiss my shame away
my prudence is not dear
inside out and feeling weird
i think ill kiss my shame away

i dont want to live alone
get on my throne
slay my shame
slay my shame

lets get gentle
lets get pissed
get your knickers in a twist
cause the angel and the devil kiss
they fell in love

some seem dirty
some stay clean
something from a madmans dream
am i really what i seem
rising to my head like cream
it feels so strange

the waters falling clear
interiors deceive i fear
i think ill kiss my shame away
my prudence is not dear
inside out and feeling weird
i think ill kiss my shame away

slay my shame
slay my shame
i dont want to live alone
get on my throne
slay my shame
slay my shame

monday morning
eighteen years dawning
i said how long
you say how long

it was one dull morning
i woke the world with bawling
i was so sad
they were so glad

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control

boys and girls
go to school
and girls
they make children
not like this one

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control

i fought fate
theres blood at the garden gate
the man said childhood
its in his childhood

one day ill die
the choice will not be mine
will it be too late
you cant fight fate

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control


theres a place i go
when i am far away
theres a tv show
and i can go

sometimes the hero takes me
sometimes i dont let go
oh oh oh

theres a picture book
with colour photographs
theres a comic strip
that makes me laugh

sometimes the lady takes me
sometimes i dont let go

stories for boys
stories for boys

a picture in grey
dorian gray
just me by the sea

and i felt like a star
i felt the world could go far
if they listened to what i said
just me my ego by the sea

it washes my feet
it washes my feet
splashes the soles of my shoes


started a landslide in my ego
looked from the outside to the world i left behind
im dreaming youre awake
if i wasnt sleeping whats at stake

a day without me

whatever the feelings i keep feeling
what are the feelings you left behind

a day without me

started a landslide in my ego
looked from the outside to the world i left behind
in the world i left behind
wipe their eyes and then let go
in the world i left behind
they shed a tear and on they go


bright morning lights
wipe the sleep
from another days eye
turn away from the wall
and theres nothing at all
being naked and afraid
in the open space of my bed

ill be with you now
ill be with you now
ill be with you now
we lie on a cloud we lie

just as i am
i awoke with a tear on my tongue
i awoke with a feeling of never before
in my sleep i discovered the one
but she was gone with the morning sun

ill be with you now
ill be with you now
ill be with you now
we lie on a cloud we lie

another time another place
we lie
another time another place
we lie
another time another place
we lie
your time your place

holding your head

walls of white protest
a gravestone in name
who is it now
its always the same

who is it now who calls me inside
are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise
i walk the street rain tragicomedy
ill walk home again to the street melody

but i know oh no
but i know oh no
but i know

shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees

life through a window
a discoloured pain
mrs browns washing is always the same
i walk the street rain tragicomedy
ill walk home again to the street melody

but i know oh no
but i know oh no
but i know

do you feel in me
anything redeeming
any worthwhile feeling
this love is like a tightrope
hanging from my ceiling

but i know oh no
but i know oh no
but i know

shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees

shadows shadows shadows
shadows shadows shadows
shadows and tall trees

shadows shadows shadows

what they call you when youre in life
ran for an ocean they runnings done
running for a lady at the speed of life
of life

my question at least you got it right
they got you when youre in sight
running from the ocean on stepping stones
running from a lady at the speed of life
of life

on your way inside a mirror turning in here in his hand
loves still well if father keeps me home it really is
i am higher way up fall


they stood on his shadow they always do
all he wanted to spoil the view
of people and places secondhand faces
he saw but never knew

oh oh oh oh

she looked like a painting a picture of you
depending on your point of view
she laughed with the others they call out her name
she smiled she said
goodbye

oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh


they met at a streetlight though she never knew
all he wanted was to spoil the view
and just for a second it felt like a year
he waited for her second tear

oh oh oh oh
oh oh


can you soar any higher if you cant let go
to save her in the fire she wont say no

oh oh oh

what in the world am i to say
theres nothing else to do
he says hell change the world some day
i rejoice

this morning i fell out of bed
when i woke up to what he had said
everythings crazy
but im too lazy to lie

and what am i to do
just tell me what am i supposed to say
i cant change the world
but i can change the world in me
rejoice
rejoice

and what am i to do
just tell me what am i supposed to say
i cant change the world
but i can change the world in me

i rejoice

rejoice
in the rest of the world


the wind of life and air from above smells of death
angels sing of the end
nothing you say and nothing you try can change time
human race prepares to die


slit my wrists take away the pain
slit my throat theres no one to blame
lost in the fields of confusion

away

right


i came here for something and im not turning back
strong in the mind but you still hold my keys
keeping my fate deep within your threshold
petty inconvenience but it means the world to me

you have the power
to set me free
caught in your grasp how
just let me be

give me control out
out of these depths
a fiery hell
i pray for death

ive been the wrong one time and time again
now im on my knees forgive me please
tore out my heart and handed to me on a silver platter
sew up the hole emptiness in the place of compassion

you made me this way
i am the product of your creation
sew up the hole right now
now you turn the other way

youve turned away from me
the futures much too far away to see
i hope you learn the truth
not the way things were meant to be with me and you


darkness coats us
the smell of fall
changing season
the graveyard is alive black cat across my path
the chill of cold wind the breath of the dead
imprisoned souls
trapped for eternity
black crows break the silence
just enjoy it
open up your mind and you will feel it too
the sound the touch the thoughts that youve been so blind to
you can feel the thoughts of the dead
feeling the thoughts of the dead
true or false its still there teaching me
true or false still there teaching me
the wood has rotted away
take the time absorb it
their time is slipping away
stone all carved by hand
statues that resemble their faces
they still breathe
come join us

smell the burning embers time flickering away
timeless but soon gone
timeless but soon gone

and i can find myself alone with just my thoughts
as time crumbles away
time crumbles away

timeless but soon gone
timeless but soon gone
and i can find myself alone with just my thoughts
as time crumbles away
time crumbles away


the endless torture
the painless pleasure
i grasp myself
trying to regain control
i experience and learn
in another faction of my mind
so confused
but everything makes perfect sense
cant feel the pain
emotional pains so much deadlier
pain your friends cant help you
why wont they help you another reality
this cant be happening
why is this happening
trying hard to figure out whats done
i scramble but now i run
the images in my head
all the problems that ive been fed
all the problems that ive been fed
punching slowly my mind cant change the speed
as my victims bleed
no matter what i do or how hard i try
i cant use my abilities
use my abilities
art of illusion
my razor sharp knifes edge pierces my victims body
but i can not take their soul
punching through jello stabbing not killing
disappointment discomfort
my razor sharp knifes edge pierces my victims body
but i cant take their soul
punching through jello stabbing not killing
disappointment discomfort


black and gray clouds willow in the balance as the sun falls
rain plays a heart warming tune on the pavement
emotions stir
a feeling of warmness compassion i feel at home
disguised by surroundings
as the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance on their mistreated lives
as the torn and left in the cold seek vengeance on mistreated lives
as the torn and left in the cold seek vengeance on mistreated lives
a silhouette stands still
but the rain falls cold and the moon shines bright
cold as ice
warm as home
ready to live
stars they shoot
in a clear
across the sky
as does my time
waiting wanting feeling emotion
crying breaking loving nothing

clouds swallow the moon and im alone thinking good times and whyd they go

falling down breaking down parts of me
falling down breaking down parts of me

clouds swallow the moon and im alone thinking good times and whyd they go


the mark i breathe on you
its burning through your soul
the breath i waste
losing control
i bleed in pain
testing what i know
lips soaked in deceit
pull me from here
no ones innocent
so why do i feel bad
guilt tearing me up inside
the innocent
an evil in disguise
the face of beauty to fall for
i fall to my knees deceitful
brought down by feelings of regret
again your mind has failed the test
not everyone feels the same
pacifist blinded by the game
stand tall theyll break your heart
stand tall theyll smash your ego
stand tall theyll tear you down
stand tall scar your soul
break your thought
the mark i breathe on you
its burning through your soul
the breath i waste
losing control
i bleed in pain
testing what i know
lips soaked in deceit
pull me from this hole


your hazel green tint eyes watching every move i make
and the feeling of doubt its erased
ill never feel alone again with you by my side
youre the one and in you i confide

and we have gone through good and bad times
but your unconditional love was always on my mind
youve been there from the start for me
and your loves always been true as can be
ill give my heart to you
i give my heart
cause nothing can compare in this world to you


so much time ive wasted
i can truly say i never thought it would come to this
never would i doubt you but the truth kept smacking me in the face
reality you never stopped to think and you ripped us apart
how could you now our time is gone but its still breaking my heart
tears run down as i think of the days weve had and the memories will last forever
but you and i have died and gone our separate ways
you are the one
you are the wrong one
breaking the mold
going your own way
all i feel betrayal


we had something great then it was washed away
we had something more then i can explain
im sorry no we had something great then it was washed away
no not all friendships last the genuine are harder to take
no time to start again hope someday youll think of me
no the end reality i know someday ill think of you


when you see them coming in form
and they say they do whats best for you
fighting for one total control
they are planned and organized for you
breaking their hold breaking their hold of control they strive
to keep you down behind your back the time has come the end is near
its not to help you but help their cause under one system you wont exist
they are the few with all the power
our system screams we cant let them tear our hearts out
screaming pulling on our pride
stand together for the right cause one system to our demise


forgotten faces
lost in yesterdays realm
drained with confusion
where did it all go
look into the past look into their faces
but now theyre all gone and all thats left is this blank faced picture
ninety percent nothing was done nothing accomplished
coasting through life didnt seize the day
no one ever realized that theyre already dead
by the time you realize youll be dead too
without another chance to save the world
these things theyre gone youre gone forgotten


its gone forever
right before my very eyes
and just when i thought i made light of things
it slips away into darkness
my life passes now i see
just what this world does hold for me
its getting hard harder to breathe
am i out of time is that what this means
well thats what it means
thats what it means you and me try to breathe
now you realize
your life flies by
now i realize
my life i die


i dont want to know
and i dont want to see you in this place
your kind is a disgrace as i spit in your face
and i dont want to hear anymore
come on you kids stand your ground
this is your show its your family
all of my friends there for me

theres fourhundred more of us then them
so kick them out
keep it positive
keep it real
keep it true
together with my friends
ill be there for you

through the problems thick and thin and problems well fight through
this is to my brothers ill be there for you
through the problems thick and thin and problems well fight through
this is to my family
ill be there for you

i dont want to know
and i dont want to see you in this place
your kind is a disgrace as i spit in your face
and i dont want to hear anymore


you live your whole life staring at a wall your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall
you never learned the things you say to know now but how
there seems to be a difference two different types of kids
the ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live
one groups taught how and the other group is taught why
theres no need to tell you whats in my mind but in the game of life im doing fine
no reason to tell you which way to be
cause the streets have opened my eyes to see
no need to tell you whats in my mind but in the game of life im doing fine
no reason to tell you which way to be
cause the streets have opened my eyes to see
look whats happening now
what are the reasons why and how
and dont you think it sounds stupid when someones treated different cause theyre not the same as me or you
you live your whole life staring at a wall your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall
you never learned the things you say to know now but how
there seems to be a difference two different types of kids
the ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live
one groups taught how and the other group is taught why
theres no need to tell you whats in my mind but in the game of life im doing fine
no reason to tell you which way to be
cause the streets have opened my eyes to see
no need to tell you whats in my mind but in the game of life im doing fine
no reason to tell you which way to be
cause the streets have opened my eyes to see


i see you fading away from us
ill miss you very much
room with empty bottles broken dreams and pride still running high always on your side
but i wanted more for you
you cant go on this way
and now i see it all fall through
we pray for better days
stuck alone and scared
throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way
i dont want to see you like this
we all tried to save you but missed
i still feel the hope on your road
now come back to us like the days of the old
i still feel you there trying to get on top
youll always have my support in my heart
people youve hurt
friends that youve lied to
i can see it too for you im scared if i lose you im not prepared
this time if you die
i watch you right before my eyes
just trust me and listen
you have no self control
this will take your life

overdose and then indulge until you die
pondering we all ask the question why
broken home and then abandoned by your dad
and we are left the only family that youve ever had

i wanted more for you
you cant go on this way
and now i see it all fall through
we pray for better days
stuck alone and scared
throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way

help you see it through
fight this me and you
reaching deep inside
problems not just you is what we find
our friendship makes it mine


fallen souls we shine so bright

rise now and ever
we command you
rise now and ever
we command you

no one can touch us


ill try she said as she walked away
try not to lose you
two vibrant hearts could change
nothing tears the being more than deception
unmasked fear
ill be here waiting tested and secure

nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sins deep in my blood
youll be the one to fall

i wish i could be the one
the one who wont care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go no ones guiding me

when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know its hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know its hurting you but its killing me

nothing will last in this life
our time is spent constructing
now youre perfecting a world meant to sin

constrict your hands around me
squeeze till i cannot breathe
this air tastes dead inside me
contribute to our plague

break all your promises
tear down this steadfast wall
restraints are useless here
tasting salvations near

nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sins deep in my blood
youll be the one to fall

i wish i could be the one
the one who wont care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go no ones guiding me

when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know its hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know its hurting you but its killing me


blood is spilt and man will follow
infernal man punishment too great to bear
conceived and born was one of light

raise your head and taste the courage
ive come here to kill you
wont leave until youve died
murder born of vengeance

and from my hands to my brothers grave
you took his side you took his gift
feel the power of a fallen man crestfallen man

far away in this land i must go
out of the sight of the one
a punishment sent from his hand
a hardship no one should know
now go out of the sight of the one
away in this land you must go

where has he gone what have you done
a voice commands from high above this earth
from the soil his blood cries out to me
murder liar vengeance deceit


with this ink in our skin weve sealed our fate
and the axe comes early
theres a bed of skeletons waiting for me
on the other side
human lives to me seem so unreal cant see through the fog
belief structure built up in you
ill tear you down and the one who created you

if they didnt have one how would they act
if we didnt have hope how would we behave
would they still feel remorse
if they slaughtered innocent beings
or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane

a good friend once told me you are memory
without it we equal nothing
and all i can see is the place i wanna be
suddenly my life was so free
leaves at my feet blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
but keep away from me keep away from me


we may have created the beginning mentally
we may have created the beginning physically
to the end of our human existence

i see through you
the fear thats in your eyes

a good friend once told me you are memory
without them we equal nothing
all i can see is the place i wanna be
timeless my life was so free
leaves at my feet blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
i dont know the answers but neither do you


hard news taken harder dont look to me
disappointed we dont agree i dont need your praise
from the beginning you came to me
never asked you to like me
look down on me spit in my face
youre nothing to me not to me

darkened eyes youll see
there is no hope no savior in me
dont look this way dont breathe this way dont stare this way anymore
learned from years gone by no one will care
what happens to me
dont look this way dont breathe this way dont stare this way anymore

my presence wont be ignored no not today
dont walk in my direction turn the other way
from the beginning you came to me
asking questions predetermined answers
and i dont want you i wont let you think
compromise is near cause its not near

darkened eyes youll see
there is no hope no savior in me
dont look this way dont breathe this way dont stare this way anymore
learned from years gone by no one will care
what happens to me
dont look this way dont breathe this way dont stare this way anymore

im alone in here
no more feelings
killed my fears
dont ask
youll never know
youre left behind and ill be exposed

far away you keep on trying
holding me down breaking away
trying to distance my life
not one in the crowd but one with the answer
the one that could change your mind

but its not true i dont need you
dont waste your time and dont waste mine
im not your friend i wont soothe your soul
and in the end youre all dead to me


black enchanting eyes
cut through my heart
with no regret or sign of life
they tear apart my pride
and cold runs through my veins
i feel their stare from miles haunting every step
and they wont stop hunting me down
i know the time will come
when all around mes burned
and youll still see me there
asking where you went to
and what person brought you here
and why you left the burning children
and calling for you all alone

dark in their hearts
i can feel it burn inside of me
tormented young with no souls haunting me
pain in their lives all they know is misery
take these chains away that are holding me down

theyll find you alone
and your desperate and villainous ways
turning their hearts into stone
they seek more then vengeance
look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
burn for the rest of time


dark in their hearts
i can feel it burn inside of me
tormented young with no souls haunting me
pain in their lives all they know is misery
take these chains away that are holding me down

eternal rest in time
eternal rest in time


we keep writing talking and planning
but everything is changing
we all know what to do but no one does it
now this time has passed and full of regret
two in my heart have left me a while i stand alone
when they get back it wont be the same

my life youve always been there
now youre gone and my heads spinning
left the childhood left the memories
left the good times in the past
moving on your time has run out
wishing the clock would stand still the world can wait
wasting away once again once lived as friends

as time passes by regrets for the rest of my life

never will i forget you and all the memories past
so rarely i get to see your face
growing i looked to you in guidance
we knew that time would kill us
but youre still so close to me

to me you were my life
to me you were my soul companion
now you are so far away
nothing can take away the time and the memories we had
come back  to the days when we were young
come back  to the days when nothing mattered
to the days when nothing mattered

and i feel time passes by regrets for the rest of my life

as time passes by regrets for the rest of my life


a bullet sunk straight through my skull
a friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
no pain as i awake but dead
seeing the face of the man
the time as he lays down his gun
i knew this was going to take place
white silence so peaceful so numb

no one knows the time theyre changing
no one will see through

ive been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay
moving on seemed to be somber bliss
without one goodbye
i watch my mother shed tears

no this gun has stopped time in its tracks
has altered the course of my fate
destiny is shattered and timeless
closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace

ill watch you call calling for me
you cant bring back time
close your eyes or look away
fate exposed and wont let me stay
descending entity in me

my voice has been taken from me
the more i listen the more i have to say

ive been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay
moving on seemed to be somber bliss
without one goodbye
i watch my mother shed tears
and taste the blood she cries

ill watch you call calling for me
you cant bring back time
close your eyes or look away
fate exposed and wont let me stay
descending entity in me


cry alone ive gone away
ive gone alone took all my strength
ive made the change

sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and loved

building up inside of me
a place so dark so cold i had to set me free
dont mourn for me
youre not the one to place the blame

sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and most of all i loved
but i cant see myself that way
please dont forget me or cry while im away

cry alone ive gone away
ive gone alone took all my strength
but ive made the change

so far away im gone
and while im gone everything will be alright

no more breath inside
no more breath inside


come back to me this is unconceivable
breaking apart the ones you love
hate runs deep for what youve done to us
left alone through suicide suicide

i just want to die take away my life
lay by your side please

come back to me this is unconceivable
breaking apart the ones you love
hate runs deep for what youve done to us
left alone through suicide

look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
no dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
hes gone nothing will take back time
i need him back but nothing will take back time

i can see just fine with you in my life
there by my side as it starts to fade
i know this cant be right stuck in a dream

i look back and see the twisted road
best friends and despair took its toll
take away take away take away take away

sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me i care for
and most of all i loved
but i cant see myself that way
please dont forget me
or cry while im away

look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
no dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
hes gone nothing will take back time
i need him back but nothing will take back time

i can see just fine with you in my life
there by my side as it starts to fade
i know this cant be right stuck in a dream


dust begins to fall to the ground
the air is cold and thin
thoughts are haunting me as i look around
this will never end when ill bleed forever

dont acknowledge right just dwell on wrong
this spot in hells where i belong
ive come so far its been so long
dont know why it started or where it came from

outside shell is strong confident
but slowly eats away
like a man plagued with disease i try to fight
through my pores it seems to seep
when ill bleed forever

dont acknowledge right just dwell on wrong
this spot in hells where i belong
ive come so far its been so long
dont know why it started or where it came from

and why you sit there and do nothing
youre content with doing nothing

theres nowhere to run and hide
when youre living to die
stuck alone inside your head
better off dead
the phone would ring in the empty house
no ones around

dont acknowledge right just dwell on wrong
this spot in hells where i belong
ive come so far its been so long
dont know why it started or where it came from

but in my life i wanted more i needed more
i taste more


lived through you
safe with how we lived our lives
with how it all turned out
uncovered lies surfaced throughout
will make you change your mind

sometimes life is altered
wont turn out right cant turn out right

when i see you i can read it in your eyes
fate misunderstood
swallowed the lies cant blame you for
thinking with your heart

sometimes life is altered
break from the ropes your hands are tied
uneasy with confrontation
wont turn out right cant turn out right

i see my world crumble and fall before my eyes
i know i know
dark will turn to light in time ill be all right
i know i know
so cold so black so alone

living goes by fast catch your breath
and it will pass you by
and it wont last to sulk with the memories you hold

sometimes life is altered
break from the ropes your hands are tied
uneasy with confrontation
wont turn out right cant turn out right

sometimes life is altered
break from the ropes your hands are tied
wont turn out right cant turn out right


this shining city built of gold
a far cry from innocence
theres more than meets the eye
round here look to the waters of the deep
a city of evil

there sat a sevenheaded beast
ten horns raised from his head
symbolic woman sits on his throne
but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
the beast and the harlot

shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

the city dressed in jewels and gold
fine linen myrrh and pearls
her plagues will come all at once
as her mourners watch her burn
destroyed in an hour

merchants and captains of the world
sailors navigators too
will weep and mourn this loss
with her sins piled to the sky
the beast and the harlot

shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

the day has come for all us sinners
if youre not a servant youll be struck to the ground
flee the burning greedy city
looking back on her to see theres nothin around

i dont believe in fairytales and no one wants to go to hell
youve made the wrong decision and its easy to see
now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
youre welcome to the city where your future is set
forever

shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great


jealousys an ugly word but you dont seem to care
converse behind my back but now im here
need no one to comply with me though everyone that i defeat

hatred fuels my blood
one king to watch the horsemen fail
now i can understand
its sorrow that feeds your lies
whoa yeah

youre on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
a crutch for you that wont always be there
hide in the dark another day
the fear in you is here to stay

hatred fuels my blood
one king to watch the horsemen fail
now i can understand
put faith in you for the last time
its sorrow that feeds your lies
ha yeah yeah

sweet child well miss you
no so far away far away

now i can understand
put faith in you for the last time
its sorrow that feeds your lies

falling away
cant buy back time
burn it down anyways


i dont know where to begin but ill start with the radical leaders
their steps were followin

running dont go back and fight too many youll lose
everyone eventually will take the step cause its in sight you take the left ill take the right i feel the hate youve built
for me and i say pay attention baby

as they thank the lord the blind cant see
like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease

but it wasnt a sin a sorry life in judging every action
how to speak how to ask all the questions

push you on the story of immortal father mortal son give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself
dont give them all the power when your futures in desperate trouble baby

as they thank the lord the blind cant see
like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
running away from condition i see you but youre running away from
youre scared seductive system

most would claim i live a lie when pointing out its easy to predict these things
every color has its side they live together vote and most wont read between these lines
please help us please save us of course they have control were all the same
up on the cross crucified their problem drove the nail and let him rot
family and friends it wont matter in the end im sure theyll understand
now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
as i sit up here and wonder bout how you sold your mind body and soul
looking at the fields so green i know this sounds obscene
i see youre living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty

as they thank the lord the blind cant see
like a plague fed to the brain deadly disease
easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to run

youve fallen asleep here in denial
look at the way were dyin
how it ends ill never know
just live your life blind like me


caught here in a fiery blaze wont lose my will to stay
the heat stroke ridden weather the barren empty sights
no oasis here to see the sand is singing deathless words to me

too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention

as i adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
my hand is on the trigger im ready to ignite
tomorrow might not make it but everythings all right
mental fiction follow me show me what its like to be set free

too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention

so sorry youre not here ive been sane too long my visions so unclear
now take a trip with me but dont be surprised when things arent what they seem

caught here in a fiery blaze wont lose my will to stay
these eyes wont see the same after i flip today

sometimes i dont know why wed rather live than die
we look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
we may get some solutions but most just pass us by
dont want your absolution cause i cant make it right
ill make a beast out of myself gets rid of all the pain of being a man

too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention

so sorry youre not here ive been sane too long my visions so unclear
now take a trip with me but dont be surprised when things arent what they seem
ive known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apart
scared but you can follow me im too weird to live but much too rare to die


our lives on hold

trashed and scattered again im feelin so low
my destination is always unknown ill find my way there

i wont be the victim but the first to cast a stone
and dont you try to stop me its a place youll never know
dont try to judge or take shots at me ill never let you seize control


right there


trashed and scattered again im feelin so low
my destination is always unknown ill find my way there
but goddamn impostor are you out of your mind

i walk down these roads alone and now youre seen here


i wont be the victim but the first to cast a stone
and dont you try to stop me its a place youll never know
dont try to judge or take shots at me ill never let you seize control

i feel your world keep dying no more use in tryin
and my bodys trashed and low but to you ill never show myself or whats inside

i wonder if she ever made the coast
she and her young man they both moved out there
but i sure hope they write just to let us know

cause this winter looks like its gonna be another bad one
but springll soon be here
oh god i hope its not late

ma and pa lived here and theirs before them

ive tried to fix the fire but you know the damn things too old

and me im getting stronger by the minute
my wifes expecting but i hope she can wait
cause this winter looks like its gonna be another bad one
but springll soon be here

so you finally came right out and said it girl
what took you so long
it was in your eyes that looks been there for too long
im waiting in line
would you say if i was wasting my time

or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh

i think about it from time to time
when im lonely and on my own

i try to forget and yet still rush to the telephone
im waiting in line
would you say if i was wasting my time

or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh
or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh

well it feels like something you want so bad
then you think youve got it but its something you already had

and i feel it coming at me
i can feel it coming at me

or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh
or did i miss again
i think i missed again

im waiting in line but would you say if i was wasting my time

or did i miss again


just as i thought id make it
you walk back into my life
just like you never left

just as id learned to be lonely
you call up to tell me
youre not sure if youre ready
but ready or not youll take what youve got and leave

leave me alone with my heart
im putting the pieces back together again
just leave leave me alone with my dreams
i can do without you know what i mean

i wish i could write a love song
to show you the way i feel
seems you dont like to listen
oh but like it or not take what youve got and leave

leave me alone with my heart
its broken in two and im not thinking too straight
just leave leave me alone with my dreams
youve taken everything else you know what i mean


i never thought id ever get tired of playing games
but ive been holding back for too long
now the time has come to get it right
nows the time to show them all that theyre wrong

cause they said thunder and they said lightning
it would never strike twice
oh but if thats true why cant you tell me
how come this feels so nice oh it feels all right

never ever did believe in guiding lights
cause what you didnt hold slipped away
oh but theres a feeling deep down in my shoe
cause things look like theyre going my way

cause they say thunder and they say lightning
it would never strike twice
oh but if thats true why cant you tell me
how come this feels so nice oh it feels all right

i never ever did believe in a second chance
you get just one crack of the whip thats all
if you played the game you got treated right
oh but im not playing the game no more

cause they say thunder and they say lightning
it would never strike twice
oh but if thats true why cant you tell me
how come this feels so nice oh it feels all right


if you feel it do it
you dont need a reason
for all you know it could be good for you

to show your feelings
dont just leave them
do the things you believe in its all right
dont worry turn around i will still be here

im not moving no really
you just try and push me out
no im not moving no really

if you think it say it
cause no one will stop you
dont keep quiet just cause you think you ought to
feel free to shout it loud speak your mind spit it out

cause im not moving no really
you just try and push me out
no im not moving i can sit it out
no really theres no hurry
so dont worry turn around i will still be here

if it hurts dont do it
cause no one can take you make you drink
and no one can tell you what you think
remember if your spirit starts to sink
dont worry turn around i will still be here


i read all the letters
i read each word that youve sent to me
and though its past now and your words
all the memories ive had still remain

ive kept all the pictures but i hide my feelings so no one knows
oh sure my friends all come round
but im in a crowd and own my own
its cause youre gone now but your heart heart still remains
and itll be here if you come again

you see id heard the rumours
i knew before you let me know
but i didnt believe it not you
no you would not let me go

seems i was wrong
but i love love you the same
and thats the one thing that you cant take away

but just remember

if leaving me is easy
then you know coming back is harder
if leaving me is easy
then you know coming back is harder

hoh


turn off your mind relax and float downstream
it is not dying it is not dying
lay down all thoughts surrender to the void
it is shining oh it is shining
that you may see the meaning of within
it is beginning oh it is beginning

that love is all and love is evryone
it is knowing oh it is knowing
and ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
it is believing oh it is believing
so play the game existence to the end
of the beginning of the beginning

of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning

and i dont know what i might be on
 north columbus was the address
that i wrote down on my sleeve

and i watched as the smoker passed it on
and i laughed when the joker said lead on
cause theres a train leaves here this morning
and i dont know what i might be on
and theres train leaves here this morning
and i dont know what i might be on

restless feeling in my soul
tempting me to get away
but theres no place a man can go

waiting so patiently
god will you lead me where i roam
help me not to let my feelings show

early in the morning
about the break of day
the earlybird is working
so his life dont fade away
spends his life denying that
hes got no time for flying
in the breeze
high up on his own the eagle flies alone
and he is free
earlybird is scratching though
the goings getting tough
time is passing by him and he just
cant get enough
hell tell you all is well when
all is really going wrong
the earlybird will wake one day
and find his life is gone

and a man could use his back or use his brains
but some just went stir crazy lord cause

till bill doolin met bill dalton
he was working cheap just bidin time
and then he laughed and said im goin
and so he left that peaceful life behind

but me ill find another way
i believe in getting what you can
and there aint no stoppin this young man

because im you and fast as i can be

and this old world still looks the same
another frame

he was a poor boy raised in a small family
he kinda had a craving for somethin no one else could see
they say that he was crazy
the kind that no lady should meet
he ran out to the city and wandered around in the street
he wants to dance oh yeah
he wants to sing oh yeah
he wants to see the lights a flashin and listen
to the thunder ring

he saw it in a window
the mark of a new kind of man
he kinda liked the feeling so shiny and smooth in his hand
he took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
and then one day he felt if
he knew he could stand with the best

they got respect oh yeah
he wants the same oh yeah
and its a certain kind of fool who
like to hear the sound of his own name
ooh

a poster on a storefront the picture of a wanted man
he had a reputation spreading like fire throught the land
it wasnt for the money at least it didnt start that way
it wasnt for the runnin but now hes runnin everyday

and i swore that i loved her and gave her a ring
the bluebird was high on the wing

finding a sweetheart and holding her tight
she saidtell me oh tell me was i all right

the years brought the railroad

and dust on the floor
and she passes the time at another mans side
and i pass the time with my pride

when i was a lad
and old shep was a pup
over hills and meadows wed stray
just a boy and his dog
we were both full of fun
we grew up together that way

i remember the time at the old swimmin hole
when i would have drowned beyond doubt
but old shep was right there
to the rescue he came
he jumped in and helped pull me out

as the years fast did roll
old shep he grew old
his eyes were fast growing dim
and one day the doctor looked at me and said
i can do no more for him jim

with hands that were trembling
i picked up my gun
and aimed it at sheps faithful head
i just couldnt do it
i wanted to run
i wish they would shoot me instead

he came to my side
and looked up at me
and laid his old head on my knee
i had struck the best friend that a man ever had
i cried so i scarcely could see

old shep he has gone
where the good doggies go
and no more with old shep will i roam
but if dogs have a heaven
theres one thing i know
old shep has a wonderful home

and i hear it calling me

i found my thrill on blueberry hill
on blueberry hill when i found you
the moon stood still on blueberry hill
and lingered until my dreams came true

the wind in the willow played
loves sweet melody
but all of those vows we made
were never to be

tho were apart youre part of me still
for you were my thrill on blueberry hill


suntanned windblown honeymooners at last alone
feeling far above par oh how lucky we are
while i give to you and you give to me
true love true love
so on and on it will always be
true love true love
for you and i have a guardian angel on high
with nothing to do but to give to you
and to give to me love forever true

jennifer lost the war today
through it all
she must have wondered
what have i done
but nobody really cares today
the worlds a busy place
guess she must have really sinned

i guess were all just soldiers
she was only six years old
left to die by strangers
her family waits
and if were all just soldiers
is it so wrong to be afraid

phoebe lost the war today
there must be some mistake
say it happens all the time
and its said and done
and little miss  your soul remains unclaimed
guess you must have really sinned

morality wont help her
when she lies silent in a morgue
and all our sorrows just dont count at all
but will the morning headlines
even say that its a shame
what are we headin for

seen it all before
silent on the ground
as hes walking away
and i wonder how many more
everybody takes it
like its nothing at all
jennifer lost the war


when we younger
there always seemed like
some perfect mold
that were supposed to be
but now were growing up and
i see its just not that way
now i feel like someones lied to me

cause ive been true
made good for you
and now i feel used
im asking you
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
to be like you

tell me now elders
what were your reasons for
making it seem
like you were so much more
if you want to feel good
because of our accomplishments
dont you just do it yourself

cause ive tried
man ive tried
while you all lied
so now just tell me
how does it feel
how does it feel


look at my soldier boy now
with that big gun in your little hand
as you patrol this foreign land
hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet

now do you see the light
fading while your world is crumbling
out on patrol
and all you can do is sit and stare
what revelation have you now
what culmination to your speck of life
your moment in time

as you sit here all alone
will your buddies come and save your life
but as the enemy appears
see your life flash before your eyes

now do you see the light
fading while your world is crumbling
out on patrol
and all you can do is sit and stare
what revelation have you now
what culmination to your speck of life
your moment in time

now do you see the light
fading while your world is crumbling
out on patrol
and all you can do is sit and stare
what revelation have you now
what culmination to your speck of life
your moment in time

its your life
its your life
its your life

its your life
its your life
its your life

uno dos tres quatro


time has washed away
and now i may wonder
how did it all slip by
cause i always thought
we had forever
future calls to me
to take me away from things
i dont want to leave behind
like im slipping away
i cant hold on

find that path alone
crossroads lead me away
but thats not what worries me
i just want to know whats home

find that path alone
crossroads lead me away
but thats not what worries me
i just want to know whats home

through it all
my mind still wanders
to the one who touched my soul
though her road leads away
shes still my
true love
i could believe

will is not enough when all those
lost days stand in the way
but she was
my hopes and dreams my
whole world
i could believe

i still want to know
who can see for me
crossroads tell me

now youll have to trade
your past away
and find another day
so is change a friend or an enemy

through what comes to pass
ill find my way
ive seen it all before
but is the best you can be
the best thing to be
some people say
youre just wasting time
but thats not what worries me
i just want to know whats home


clouds pass over the moon
like an eye that shows impending doom
tension in this misty air
souls pass into the room
drawn in by a lost memory
you will join them in the moonlight

you are my offering
your soul transcends
the centuries of pain
your misery in life
is your ecstasy in death

time passes like the wind
as we race to beat days dusky grin
mornings just a moment away
your body glistens in candlelight
as we all look on in fiendish delight
the ritual is just beginning

come fulfill the prophecy
with our demons of debauchery
as virgins and spectres sing
this madness will never cease

you will follow
in the footsteps of many others
who have come before
i will show you the altar
your aztec eyes egyptian hair
your beauty bestowed upon my lair
ive loved you before in other lives
but youve never meant as much to me
never meant as much to me as now

where blood is spilt
that will never spill again
but in your linen robes
we want you now
we want you now
you could never ask for more than that

you are my offering
your soul transcends
the centuries of pain
your misery in life
is your ecstasy in
come fulfill the prophecy
with our demons of debauchery
this madness will never cease


mommy doesnt have a head any more
keep it underneath my bed on the floor
well thats alright thats ok
she never really used her head anyway

daddy called me a silly bore
bet he wont say that any more
because the way his body is severed too
his vocal chords are gonna be hard to use

beheaded watch you spurt like a garden hose
beheaded bloody mess all over my clothes

watch my girl friend come to the door
chop off her head she falls to the floor
now watching my babys jugular blow
really makes my motor go

wrap a towel round the bloody stump
take my babys body to the city dump
then wipe the mess off the bloody axe
scoop all the heads into my burlap sack

beheaded watch her spurt like a garden hose
beheaded bloody mess all over my clothes

all my collection adorns my room on bamboo poles
use to be a little but a little got more and more
now im craving yours


off with her head
off with her head
off with her head
off with her head
off with her head
off with her head

find another victim for my machine
put him in a homemade guillotine
blade falls gonna need a casket
watch your head plop in a wicker basket

leave the house at a quarter to four
come back with sixteen or more
cause the more i walk the more i see
i got a funny feeling coming over me

beheaded watch you spurt like a garden hose
beheaded bloody mess all over my clothes


in your plane in the blue sky
you roam again
words that echo in your mind
make your heart beat faster
this is no vietnam
we will win in iran

the president said let it ride
islam be damned
make your last stand
in tehran

warrior the time bombs
about to go
what will you feel
will you even wonder
if the man thats in your sights
ever kissed his girl goodbye

the captain said kill or die
islam be damned
make your last stand
in tehran

great satan
our flags our burning

soon america may find
its young men in the sand
where their casualty
is just a number
in iran

the president said let it ride
you will be damned
make your last stand
in tehran


ask me no questions and ill tell you
ill tell you no lies
when all is said and done
does it really matter whos wrong or right
dont ask me for a reason i cant explain
why we hurt one another again and again
as i lie bleeding here i still
i still reach for you

a thousand days
have passed away
a thousand days
were captured in her eyes

your eyes are open now but you know
its still hard to see inside
when action and intention
are two separate things
now i somehow wish i could explain
why we hurt each other again and again
like someone on his dying breath
i still reach for you

a thousand days
have passed away
a thousand days
were captured in her eyes

forever weve been
trapped by our hearts
trapped by our minds
id like to leave
id like to win at love

but i just cant let it go
and i just cant watch it slipping away
and i just cant let it go
and i just cant stand another minute

maybe now someday our shattered live
will mend themselves again
but now a million miles away
i still wish i could
and though i somehow know i cant explain
why we hurt one another again and again
like someone on his dying breath
i still reach for you


in this world of hate and shallowness
where enemies become your consolation
and those of us who win the game give up our minds
i dont call that winning
say this doesnt apply to you
but ask yourself first
what have i done today to win the game
and just what have i sacrificed

win the battle lose the war
i know ive played this game before
when people were still real
i dont want this anymore
its time for me to close the door
theres nothing left to feel

reflect on all our yesterdays
my own words choke me
why were they spoken
regret for the things ive said and done
just cant compare with
regret for those that i have never tried
so blame this world or blame yourself
its really all the same
when you are standing on the precipice
from which you just cannot return

win the battle or lose the war
i know ive played this game before
when people were still real
i dont want this anymore
its time for me to close the door
theres nothing left to feel

in the style of forgotten men
i look to my horizon
i see nothing
while thoughts of guns and desecration
sweep through my mind
but only coffins and bones remain
as i look to you
the emptiness behind your eyes
seals my decision
cant carry on in this world of jugglers
where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeonings
your key to success
what kind of tradition to carry on

blackball the new disease
blackball the new disease
blackball your evil ways
have found their way inside me

blackball the new disease
blackball the new disease
blackball for a better life
in this high tech dog eat dog existence


once i had a friend that i could count on
so i thought
well so it seemed
but times of need are not enough
to prove your friendship to me now
once i saw a face that i believed in
but a mask was all there was
so who wears the masks and who wears the faces
well i guess ill never know

but as i stand here alone in a room full of people
with nothing to say
beer on their minds and smoke in the air
call them friends but they just dont care

friend for life
such shallow words for broken minds
show me a friend for life
cause ill be waiting for that day to arrive
when ill feel alive
ill be waiting for that day

once i found a love i had to know
now we might know each other just too well
cause when were together we just cant get enough
or is it we just cant get what we want
once i saw a dream i had to chase it
dreams quickly turn to reality
whos at fault in this game of yours and mine
well i guess ill never know

but as i sit here alone
think of the girl who came softly inside me
the look in her eyes the smell of her hair
call her my own but is she really there

love for life
such noble words for noble minds
show me a love for life
cause ill be waiting for that day to arrive
when ill feel alive
ill be waiting for that day

once i had a friend that i could count
times of need are not enough
once i found a love i had to know
now we might know each other just too well
once i saw a dream i had to chase
dreams quickly turn to reality
now let me close my eyes
because i dont want to see anything anymore


in a world without leaders
whod start all the wars
the world that youre saving
will always be yours

kill the president listen to the voice of reason
unify with that single line
stop the man with the power of the government
a leaders not the center of democracy

in a world without leaders
whod make people starve
the world that were saving
will always be ours

everyone says well maybe ill make a difference
thinking theyve got plenty of time
but youre squeezed a little tighter everyday
punished before you can commit a crime

in a world without leaders
whod start all the wars
the world that youre saving
will always be yours

kill the president listen to the voice of reason
unify with that single line
stop the man with the power of the government
a leaders not the center of democracy

america all of your enemies come from within
but you lash out so it is seen like some frightened child
in an angry world or the fall of rome
your demise comes from your own hands

in a world without leaders
whod start all the wars
the world that youre saving
will always be yours

in a world without leaders
we might have a chance
but well never see it
as long as theres

kill the president
kill the president
kill the president

ive been told that to get what you want
you just gotta give what you can
but i know for what i want it dont come easy as that

to just have one thing to turn out right
for the thousandth time you turn and find
that it just makes no difference to try
like holden caulfield i tell myself
theres got to be a better way
then i lay in bed and stare at the ceiling
dream of brighter days

still cant get it right
still cant get it right
still cant get it right
and for all i know
i swear i never will

no way out
same old stuff always drags me down
no way out
never gonna get it

and for all i know
i swear i never

its a mentality that kills the best we better stop

when you wont go along
some will feel like you cant find your way
heaven knows
heaven knows ive seen it all before

now dont get me wrong
ive seen many a life gone astray
when someone goes
all your bows wont make it any better so let it go

shut up and take it like a man
you need us to get a life
for your own good well take you by the hand
cause you need a little more

maybe no one will say it
maybe no ones aware it goes on
all i know
all i know its like going off the deep end

could you make a decision
could you think for yourself and go on
everyone knows
everyone knows youve got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes

shut up and take it like a man
you need us to get a life
for your own good well take you by the hand
cause you need a little more

close your eyes
look away now
make believe while you can

so youd best go along
dont let on if you cant find your way
many more
many more do it for you
because heaven knows
heaven knows its like playing with fire
your lifes a throw


ive been told that to get what you want
you just gotta give what you can
but i know for what i want it dont come easy as that
they say look out boy
tomorrow comes and things will look better by then
but ill look out the window
then look in the mirror at the same old me again

still cant get it right
still cant get it right
still cant get it right
and for all i know
i swear i never will

do you think youd sell your soul
to just have one thing to turn out right
for the thousandth time you turn and find
that it just makes no difference to try
like holden caulfield i tell myself
theres got to be a better way
then i lay in bed and stare at the ceiling
dream of brighter days

still cant get it right
still cant get it right
still cant get it right
and for all i know
i swear i never will

no way out
same old stuff always drags me down
no way out
never gonna get it

still cant get it right
still cant get it right
still cant get it right
and for all i know
i swear i never
never never never never get it


in my own simple way
i think she wants me only
she said come over right away
but shes just not that way
her little soul is stolen
see her put on her brand new face

pull the shades
razor blades
youre so tragic
i hate you so
but love you more
im so elastic
the things you say
games you play
dirty magic

i should know better than
to think id reach inside her
its all a cloudy kind of daze
shes not so sweet today
she mocks me im no fighter
it all just seems like such a waste

pull the shades
razor blades
youre so tragic
i hate you so
but love you more
im so elastic
the things you say
games you play
dirty magic

its oversimplified
its oversimplified
its oversimplified
its oversimplified

pull the shades
razor blades
youre so tragic
i hate you so
but love you more
im so elastic
the things you say
games you play
dirty magic


when youre feeling low
hypodermics where you go
when youre with yourself
you wish you could be someone else

cant you see like you saw anymore
cant you feel like you felt before
cant you face anything anymore

when lifes a waste
run away
your lifes a waste
run away

once you get a ride
doesnt matter where you lied
once you shoot it in
doesnt matter who youve been

cant you see like you saw anymore
cant you feel like you felt before
cant you face anything anymore

when lifes a waste
run away
your lifes a waste
run away

youre reaching in
but you dont know where to begin
all your dance and song
wont matter when youre gone

cant you see like you saw anymore
cant you feel like you felt before
cant you face anything anymore

when lifes a waste
run away
your lifes a waste
run away
run away
run away
run away

run away


i think im burning up inside
i think ill take a little ride
im gonna light up everything in sight
ill drive on by your yard
and throw a molotov cocktail at your car
then another in the local bar

ignition
they call it an obsession
i think its kinda neat
yeah im a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah im a pyro

im gonna set your house on fire
ill dance around the pretty flames
such a wonderful game

i want to make a tiki torch
im gonna throw it on your porch
then im gonna run away
and come back another day

ignition
they call it an obsession
i think its kinda neat
yeah im a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah im a pyro

so many houses so little time
so many reasons im not a crime
id like to set you up
id like to set you up

ignition
they call it an obsession
i think its kinda neat
yeah im a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah im a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah im a pyro
yeah im a pyro
yeah im a pyro


once you said youd stick to it until the end
i guess you lied they call it suicide
now youre gone
what was so wrong that you couldnt find a way to carry on
second guess
did i do my best
there was a friend i had

johnny was a weirdo so
what did you expect
im just trying to survive myself

i should have known you went through it alone
i wonder why did you even try
you could have come to me
i would have helped you see
you could have found a way to carry on
second guess
did i do my best
there was a friend i had

johnny was a weirdo so
what did you expect
im just trying to survive myself

johnnys strange behavior
was a tipoff they say
im just living day by day

little things little lives hanging til the end
i say it doesnt really mean nothing
telling truth telling lies
i used to have a friend
i say it dont really mean nothing
and i cant let this feeling go
let this feeling go
let this feeling go
let this let it go

once you said youd stick to it until the end
i guess you lied they call it suicide
now youre gone
what was so wrong that you couldnt find a way to carry on
second guess
did i do my best
there was a friend i had

johnny was a weirdo so
what did you expect
im just trying to survive myself

johnnys strange behavior
was a tipoff they say
im just living day by day


when cops are taking care of business i can understand
but the la storys gone way out of hand
their acts of aggression they say theyre justified
but it seems an obsession has started from the inside

theyre shooting anyone who even tries to run
theyre shooting little kids with toy guns
take it to a jury but they dont give a damn
because the one who tells the truth is always the policeman

beat whoever you see
dont need a reason

the city of la feels like a prison
with helicopters overhead and bullets whizzing by
martial law aint no solution
police brutalitys just social pollution

beat all the white trash
beat whoever you see
dont need a reason

they say theyre keeping the peace but im not buying it
because a billy club aint much of a pacifier
protecting your freedom man thats just a lie
its an excuse for power thats more like an alibi

law and order doesnt really matter
when youre the one getting bruised and battered
you take it to a jury theyll throw it in your face
because justice in la comes in a can of mace now

beat whoever you see
dont need a reason
lapd
lapd
lapd


things are coming down on me
they never seem to let it be
it seems like everything i say just starts another fight
the pressures building up inside
shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright

gonna break it
and never stop running
making nothing from something
making nothing from something

cut me for the lions share
its mindless but i dont care
cause no matter what i say im in another fight
broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright

gonna break it
and never stop running
making nothing from something
making nothing from something

gonna break it
and never stop running
making nothing from something
making nothing from something


look at me while i look at you
seeing eye to eye we can never do
you try to tell me what is right
i may not know a lot but i know one thing

if youve got the answer
then i dont want to know
if youve got the answer
just keep it your own

i wonder why our world is ablaze
sometimes i speak aloud to hear what people have to say
i try to have an open mind
but your brain and mouth must not be connected

if youve got the answer
then i dont want to know
if youve got the answer
just leave me alone

i would be patient but it takes so long
i dont want all this misinformation
all the words that you say
lean on me while i lean on you
if we destroy each other
we might save a life or two
a little sun a little shine
separates us both by forever and a day

if youve got a vision
then i dont want to see
if youve got a notion
dont waste it on me


ah its time to relax
you know what that means
a glass of wine your favorite easy chair
and of course this compact disc
playing on your home stereo

so go on and indulge yourself
thats right kick off your shoes
put your feet up
lean back and just enjoy the melodies
after all music soothes even the savage beast


our generation sees the world
not the same as before
we might as well just throw it all

and live like theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow

we are the ones
who are living under the gun everyday
you might be gone before you know

so live like theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow

hey believe it
the official view of the world has changed
in a whole new way
live fast cause if you dont take it
youll never make it

so if you understand me
and if you feel the same
then you will know what nitro means

youll live like theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow
theres no tomorrow


hey man you know im really ok
the gun in my hand will tell you the same
but when im in my car dont give me no crap
cause the slightest thing and i just might snap

when i go driving i stay in my lane
but getting cut off it makes me insane

open the glove box
reach inside
cause i got a bad habit
of blowin away yeah yeah
i got a bad habit yeah yeah
and it aint goin away yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
oh oh ooh oh

they say the roads a dangerous place
if you flip me off ill get in your face
you drive on my ass
your foots on the gas
and your next breath is your last

cause i got a bad habit
of blowin away yeah yeah
i got a bad habit yeah yeah
and it aint goin away yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
oh

drivers are rude
such attitudes
but when i show my piece
complaints cease somethings odd
i feel like im god

i open the glove box
reach inside
cause i got a bad habit
of blowin away yeah yeah
i got a bad habit yeah yeah
and it aint goin away yeah yeah
oh oh ooh oh


starry sky oh starry sky

why do all you favors fall
is this in your plan

every hour of every day
shell await for you
shell await a thousand years
and save herself for you

until the day and my goddess away
for you under planet and feed you a pomagranite
the lady will be faking love
from a firey pit

lights up a bright room

i watch you rest with lunar eclipses
come up from a goddess of love
come with me goddess of love

goddess of love
goddess of love


just two good old boys
never meaning no harm
beats all you never saw
been in trouble with the law
since the day they was born

straightening the curves
flattening the hills
well someday the mountain might get em
but the law never will

making their way
the only way they know how
thats just a little bit more
than the law will allow

just two good ol boys
wouldnt change if they could
theyre fighting the system
like two modernday robin hoods


headache you give me such a headache
and i dont know why
headache you can be such a headache
cause youre so uptight

sometimes its just so hard
to put up with you
ive come to rely on a pill or two
cause you cause me such pain
why does it act this way
im so frustrated with everything
wont you be nice
bring some ice for my head

headache you give me such a headache
and i dont know why
headache you can be such a headache
cause youre so uptight

sometimes its just so hard
to sleep beside you
while were in bed
i still lie awake

with a headache you can be such a headache
and i dont know why
headache you can be such a headache yeah

in my head
in my head
in my head

and i dont know why


how can you go on this way
a waste of every day
its meaningless and sad
and i just have to say
that no one really wants to see you try
i think youre a hundred times as good

now what makes you want to stay
i ask it everyday
its not as if they had

respect for what you say
cause they dont really want you to succeed
theyre happy with the way you have a need for them
i think you should push them all away
even if you stay and succeed
you will know that its nonsense
and it doesnt wash off for a very long time

so dont be the one that didnt have the nerve
to stand up for yourself because you had to serve
someone with some pretty dumb ideas


aint that bad a place
i was born that way
i bite my fingernails
still got bills to pay
you sure know what to say
ill put you in your place
land of the free im on my way

i love the usa
i love the usa

planes up in the sky

a boy who didnt make it


you know id like to think
that youve been pretty cool
but i have given up lying to myself
you know it makes me laugh
to see you doing well
but it never fails to leave me so mystified
id like to know i dont think
that i will ever understand

feeling pretty good about the big success
what makes people feel the need to get their fill


i guess its not too hard to preach it to the choir
when you show them how to sing it and they sing along

id like to know i dont think that i will ever understand
it beats me down a little further every single day

ive made a natural selection of course its none of the above

id like to know i dont think that i will ever understand
i want to feel like i dont have to try and understand


i understand the need to feel love
but this time youve gone way too far
and now you believe that everyones bad
and everyones evil inside
i dont understand how you can think that way
cause there is a book and it says that this is all true

i understand the need to feel safe
but this time youve gone way too far


its easy to see when you believe
that were all so evil inside
there are so many that want you to think that way

cause there is a book and it says that this is all true
yes there is a book and it says that this is all true
there is a book and it says that this is all true
yes there is a book and it says that this is all true


any day now youll call me up on the phone

to make it up to you somehow
and meet you on the other side of home

that were waging on each other forever more

its all that i can do right now
to make it up to you somehow
and meet you on the other side of home

its all that i can do right now
to make it up to you somehow
and meet you on the other side of home

my brain is working overtime
i need something to ease my mind
cause as my thoughts go manic
i really start to panic
theres no place to hind behind

im freaking and hallucinating
going last when i should wait
my parents think im crazy
but damn im going crazy
i cant help my mental state

no
take these brains out of my way

i work into a frenzied fit
i bite the corners of my lip
im losing my appetite
my pants dont even fit right
take away the the month old dip
give me something for my hair
a fresher pair of underwear
cause if i was run over
by a brand new range rover
i just want it i dont care

no
take these brains out of my way

its you who decides what sick or health
and all the people i see
thats making lots of benjis
make me want to puke myself
start a brand new fashion trend
those are for the deeper end
sedatives and no doz
and edible pantyhose
theyre on your plate so dig right in

no
take these brains out of my way

i dont care


my evaline
say youll be mine
wont you come and let me whisper in your ear
way down yonder in the old corn fields
for you i pine
sweeter than the honey to the honey bee
i love you
say you love me
meet me in the shed
of the old apple tree

my summer girl
she was my world
hes got her now
charmed her some how

i know im not your type
i know im not your type
i know im not your type
ill never be your type

all summer long
feelings grew strong


all through the time
i was not blind

my summer girl
my summer girl
my summer girl
my summer girl

ill never be your type
ill never be your type


everybody dont make me laugh
cause its not so insane
in the morning it comes to pass
and theres no one to blame

ill tell you
my weakness

and if you knew the things i say
then youd have to believe
in the spirits above the sand
and the man in the tree

ill tell you
my weakness

if you like it there
ill be most everywhere
tell me to stay
leave me to stay

ill tell you
my weakness

if you like it there
ill be most everywhere
tell me to stay
leave me to stay


is this it are we done
must we carry on
like such fools shameless fools
is it finally over
why when i call must you take so long
maybe weeks sometimes months
for you to call me back


my friends were right
should have played it smooth
should have tried to laugh


instead of being true

i feel so numb inside
as i rest my head to go to sleep

one more time
though i know its wrong
maybe you should do mine
and everything is fine



are you ready

this place inside my mind
a place id like to hide
you dont know the chances
what if i should die

a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you dont know the chances
im so blind
blind
blind

another means ill find
to escape the pain inside
you dont know the chances
what if i should die

a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you dont know the chances
im so blind
blind
blind

deeper and deeper and deeper as i dream to
live a life that seems to be
a lost reality
that i can never find a way to reach
my inner selfesteem is low
how deep can i go
in the ground that i lay
if i dont find a way to
see through the gray that clouds my mind
this time i look to see whats between the lines

i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind

i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind

i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind
i can see i can see im goin blind

im blind
im blind
im blind

cause they dont need a man like me in town
i pick cotton down on the dixie line
work hard all day tryin to make a dime
but thats all right thats ok by me
cause thats the way that it was meant to be

big city hard times dont bother me
im a country boy im as happy as i can be

i dont like smoke chokin up my air
and some of those city folks well they dont care
i dont like cars buzzing around
i dont even want a piece of concrete in my town
i like sunshine fresh clean air
makes me feel like you wouldnt care but
thats all right each to his own
but one smell from the city
and this country boy is gone
big city hard times dont bother me
im a country boy im as happy as i can be

well i dont want to even read about it

let me tell you something let me tell you true
whats right for me might not be right for you
well you live your way ill live mine
and i hope that your happy all the time
i pick cotton down on the dixie line
work hard all day tryin to make a dime

cause thats the way that it was supposed to be

she hit town like a rose in bloom
smellin sweet said sweet perfume
the color faded and the petals died
down in the city no one cried
in the streets the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
they moved in and made a tenement home

i said nice boys
dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll
im not a nice boy

sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
wanted so bad to be part of the scene
she met the man and she did the smack
paid the price layin flat on her back
wanted so bad just to please the boys
they ended up just being a toy
played so hard burned her life away
lies were told no promises made

you know nice boys
dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll
im not a nice boy and i never was

young and fresh when she hit town
hot for kicks just to get around
but now she lays in a filthy room
she kills the pain with
a flick and a spoon
and in the streets the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
you know the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
moved in and made a tenement home

nice boys dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll

where as a child id hide
and pray for the thunder and the rain
to quietly pass me by

wanna tell you a story
bout a woman i know
when it comes to lovin
oh she steals the show
she aint exactly pretty
aint exactly small
fortytwo thirtynine fiftysix
you could say shes got it all

never had a woman
never had a woman like you
doing all the things

aint no fairy story
aint no skin and bone
but you give it all you got
weighing in at nineteen stone

youre a whole lotta woman

whole lotta rosie
and youre a whole lotta woman

oh honey you can do it
only one to turn
only one to turn me on
and right around the clock
to my surprise
rosie never stops


shes got a smile that it seems to me
reminds me of childhood memories
where everything was as fresh
as the bright blue sky

now and then when i see her face
she takes me away to that special place
and if i stare too long
id probably break down and cry

woah oh oh sweet child o mine
woah oh oh oh sweet love of mine

shes got eyes of the bluest skies
and if they thought of rain
id hate to look into those eyes
and see an ounce of pain

her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
where as a child id hide
and pray for the thunder and the rain
to quietly pass me by

woah oh oh sweet child o mine
woah oh oh oh sweet love of mine

oh oh yeah
woah oh oh oh sweet child o mine
woah oh oh oh sweet love of mine
woah oh oh oh sweet child o mine ooh yeah

she hit town like a rose in bloom
smellin sweet said sweet perfume
the color faded and the petals died
down in the city no one cried
in the streets the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
they moved in and made a tenement home

i said nice boys
dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll
im not a nice boy

sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
wanted so bad to be part of the scene
she met the man and she did the smack
paid the price layin flat on her back
wanted so bad just to please the boys
they ended up just being a toy
played so hard burned her life away
lies were told no promises made

you know nice boys
dont play rock and roll
nice boys dont play rock and roll
im not a nice boy and i never was

young and fresh when she hit town
hot for kicks just to get around
but now she lays in a filthy room
she kills the pain with
a flick and a spoon
and in the streets the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
you know the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
moved in and made a tenement home

shes got her halo and wings
hidden under his eyes
but shes an angel for sure
she just cant stop telling lies

but its too late for his love
already caught in a trap
his angels kiss was a joke
and she is not coming back

because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
keep him tied to a dream
and only she can set him free

and then he says to me
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

yeah shes got a criminal mind
hes got a reason to pray
his life is under the gun
hes got to hold everyday

now he just wants to wake up
yeah just to prove its a dream
cause shes an angel for sure
but that remains to be seen

because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
keep him tied to a dream
and only she can set him free

and then he says to me

im not a rat to be spat upon
locked up in this room
those bars that look towards the sun

everyday the swallows play
in the clouds of love
make me wish that i had wings
take me high above

and i looked high
saw the empty sky
if i could only
could only fly

id drift with them
in endless space
but no man flies
from this place

and stare towards the stars
and home seems oh so far

if i could only swing
upon those twinkling dots above
id look down from the heavens
upon the ones i love

hey the lucky locket
hangs around your precious neck
some luck i ever got with you
and i wouldnt like to bet

that sooner or later youll own
just one half of this land
by shining your eyes on the wealth
of every man

just send up my love
aint seen nothing but tears
now ive got myself
in this room for years


the seadogs have all sailed their ships
into the docks of dawn
while the sirens sit and comb their hair
and twiddle with their thumbs

oh thor above the mountain
look down upon your children
this is their heaven where theyre told
to bring their galleons

seek you find your place with me
men of iron men of steel
only the brave hear the hammers ring
in the courts of the queens in the halls of the kings

you can come to valhala in your own time
come to valhala seek and you will find valhala
come to valhala in your own time
come to valhala seek and you will find valhala

theres long boats in the harbor
which arrive there every hour
with the souls of the heroes
whose blood lies on the flowers

and this heaven is the home
of every man who loves his sword
and he uses it for freedom
to preach the word of thor


its hard to feel whats in your head
where the gas lamps grow
and the garbage blows
around the paper stands

and a baby cried
and i saw a light
and i wondered where
and i wondered why
thered be a loss of life

down on western ford gateway
thats a place where the dead say
that a man lives no more
that his fair share of days
down on western ford gateway

it flowed upon the cobbled floor
for the bottles dead
and theyre drunk again
by the tavern door


she chose the soft center
and took it to bed with her mother
and the ideal confusion
was just an illusion
to gain further news of her brother

and the comfort of mother
was just an appeal for protection
for the cat from next door
was found later at four
in surgical dissection

and i dont want to be
the son of any freak
who for a chocolate center
can take you off the street

for soon theyll plough the desert
and god knows where ill be
collecting submarine numbers
on the main street of the sea

the vicar is thicker
and i just cant see through to him
for his cardinal sings
a collection of hymns
and a collection of coins is made after

and who wrote the bible
was it judas or pilate
well one cleans his hands
while the other one hangs
but still i continue to stand


look up little brother
can you see the clover
no not over there
a little bit left and over there

now look and see the lilac tree
the lily pond the skylarks song
the open air but no one cares
if branches live and die out there

remember when you were nine
and i was ten
we would run into the woods
no we never will again

and lady whats tomorrow
whats tomorrow anyway
if its not the same as now
its the same as yesterday

yes lady whats tomorrow
will it be the same as now
will the farmer push the pen
will the writer pull the plough

look up little brother
can you see the clover
oh sorry but its over
now theres concrete and no clover


i viewed in my presence
my hand on my forehead
and sighting the liners
of mad merchant seamen
in search of the living
or the spices of china

lucy walked gently
between the damp barrels
and shut out my eyes
with the width of her fingers
said shed guessed the number
of bales in the back room

while the seagulls were screaming
lucy was eating
then we hauled up our colors
the way the mother had told us
and together we just watched the sails

lucy i said
in a passage of cotton kegs
can we hold hands
im sure that its warmer
then the gulls ate the crumbs
of lucys sandwich


in orient where wise i was
to please the way i live
come give the beggar chance at hand
his life is on his lip

three score a thousand times
where once in amazon
where eldorado holds the key
no keeper holds my hand

unchain the gate of solitude
the ruler says you run
run hard unto the scaffold high
your chance to jump the gun

oh how high the scaffold grows
the plant life of your widow
in black lace curtains brought you near
from out the plate glass window

the minotaur with bloody hands
is enraged by the sun
caged he by the corpses
brought forth by the dawn

in orient is as i told
the buckshee hangman swears
for open crypts to silence
nylon knots to sway by prayer

in orient where wise i was
to please the way i live
come give the beggar chance at hand
his life is on his lip


turn me loose from your hands
let me fly to distant lands
over green fields trees and mountains
flowers and forest fountains
home along the lanes of the skyway

for this dark and lonely room
projects a shadow cast in gloom
and my eyes are mirrors
of the world outside
thinking of the way
that the wind can turn the tide
and these shadows turn
from purple into grey

for just a skyline pigeon
dreaming of the open
waiting for the day
he can spread his wings
and fly away again
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
youve left so very far behind
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
youve left so very far behind

just let me wake up in the morning
to the smell of new mown hay
to laugh and cry to live and die
in the brightness of my day

i want to hear the pealing bells
of distant churches sing
but most of all please free me
from this aching metal ring
and open out this cage towards the sun

for just a skyline pigeon
dreaming of the open
waiting for the day
he can spread his wings
and fly away again
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
youve left so very far behind
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
youve left so very so very far behind


gullivers gone to the final command of his master
his watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
and the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
but the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
as the sheep that he locked in the pen

theres four feet of ground in front of the barn
thats sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
but now it lies empty so cold and so bare
gullivers gone but his memory lies there

by passing the doors of his life was a stage i remember
and in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
for sentiment touched him as cyclamen holds him
and later men came from the town
who said clear the child this wont take a while
and gullivers gone with the dawn


when the shrill winds are screaming
and the evening is still
lady samantha glides over the hill
in a long satin dress that she wears every day
her home is the hillside her bed is the grave

lady samantha glides like a tiger
over the hills with no one beside her
no one comes near
they all live in fear
but lady samantha she sheds only tears

are out of proportion and none of them right
she is harmless and empty of anything bad
for she once had something that most of you have


the sister of sunlight
comes to my lonely life
bearing the crosses i hung
i hung on my lonely wife
and the anchor told me
if i prayed by the river
that the sweet sound of water
would always go with her

all across the havens to the waterfall
they told me i would meet her there
inside those icy walls
but how on earth in this universe
can they forgive me of my pains
for all across the havens
i must stumble locked in chains

then the mother of mercy
showed me her stable
and told me you would be safe
safe in her cradle
and the waterfall opened
and the water withdrew
leaving me standing
on a road leading through


hey there
look in the mirror
are you afraid you might see me looking at you
waiting waiting at windows
oh its me that you need
yes its me and im waiting for you

but i remain silent
oh i wont say a word
i leave you to realise im the light in your world
and its me yes its me yes its me yes its me
that youre needing
its me yes its me yes its me yes its me
that you need
yes its me yes its me yes its me
if you want to be living
im the one whos forgiving
admit that its me that you need

watching watching the swallows fly
it all means the same
just like them
you can fly home again
but dont no dont forget yesterday
pride is an ugly word girl
and you still know my name


i looked up from my glass into the sky
theres no one in my comic book to buy
calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away

so stop in the sky and tell me why
youre changing your colours before my eyes
yellow blue green and grey
settled on the window pane

it made the rain that came seem strange
just like strange rain
it made the rain that came seem strange
just like strange rain

still i sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
come in colours from above into my citadel
my eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
and now it seems as though its just just like strange rain


its a little bit funny this feeling inside
im not one of those who can easily hide
i dont have much money but boy if i did
id buy a big house where we both could live

if i was a sculptor but then again no
or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
i know its not much but its the best i can do
my gift is my song and this ones for you

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that its done
i hope you dont mind i hope you dont mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while youre in the world

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well a few of the verses well theyve got me quite cross
but the suns been quite kind while i wrote this song
its for people like you that keep it turned on

so excuse me forgetting but these things i do
you see ive forgotten if theyre green or theyre blue
anyway the thing is what i really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes ive ever seen

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that its done
i hope you dont mind i hope you dont mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while youre in the world

i hope you dont mind i hope you dont mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while youre in the world

for i need your love your love protects my fears

and i wonder sometimes and i know im unkind
but i need you to turn to when i act so blind

i was one as you were one
and we were two so much in love forever
i loved the white socks that you wore
but you dont wear white socks no more now youre a woman
i joked about your turnedup nose
and criticized your school girl clothes
but would i then have paced these roads to love you
for seasons come and seasons go
bring forth the rain the sun and snow
make valerie a woman
and valerie is lonely

no more to roam on the snow hills of hienton
undecided with the guardians of the older generation
a doormat was a sign of welcome
in the winter months to come
and in the summer laughing
through the castle ruins wed run

for the quadrangle sang to the sun
and the grace of our feeling
and the candle burned low as we talked of the future
underneath the ceiling
there were tears in the sky
and the clouds in your eyes were just cover
for your thighs were the cushions
of my love and yours for each other
the songs still are sung
it was fun to be young
but please dont be sad where ere you are

i am who i am
you are who you are
now valeries a woman
now valeries a woman
now valeries a woman

let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
theres a man over there whats his color i dont care
hes my brother let us live in peace
hes my brother let us live in peace
hes my brother let us live in peace


peering out of tiny eyes
the grubby hands that gripped the rail
wiped the window clean of frost
as the morning air laid on the latch
a whistle awakened someone there
next door to the nursery just down the hall
a strange new sound you never heard before
the strange new sound that make boys explore
tread neat so small those little feet
amid the morning his small heart beats
so much excitement yesterday
that must be rewarded must be displayed

large hands lift him through the air
excited eyes contain him there
the eyes of those he loves and knows
but whats this extra bed just here
his puzzled head tipped to one side
amazement swims in those bright green eyes
glancing down upon this thing
that makes strange sounds strange sounds that sing

in those silent happy seconds
that surround the sound of this event
a parent smile is made in moments
they have made for you a friend
and all you ever learned from them
until you grew much older
did not compare with when they said
this is your brand new brother
this is your brand new brother
this is your brand new brother la la la la la la


have you ever lived in a cage
where you live to be whipped and be tamed
for ive never loved in a cage
or talked to a friend or just waved

well i walk while they talk about virtue
just raised on my back legs and snarled
watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
and tell dirty jokes as he died

but im damned when i really care there
for the cellars the room in your lives
where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
and close the cage doors on your life

well i pray while you bathe in bad water
sing songs that i learnt as a boy
then break all the bones in my body
on the bars you can never destroy


no mans a jester playing shakespeare
round your throne room floor
while the jugglers act is danced upon
the crown that you once more

and sooner or later
everybodys kingdom must end
and im so afraid your courtiers
cannot be called best friends

caesars had your troubles
widows have to cry
while mercenaries in cloisters sing
and the king must die

some men are better staying sailors
take my word and go
but tell the ostler that his name was
the very first they chose

and if my hands are stained forever
and the altar should refuse me
would you let me in would you let me in would you let me in
should i cry sanctuary

caesars had your troubles
widows have to cry
while mercenaries in cloisters sing
and the king must die

yeah the king must die
the king must die oh yeah

no mans a jester playing shakespeare
round your throne room floor
while the jugglers act is danced upon
the crown that you once more

the king is dead the king is dead
the king is dead the king is dead
long live the king


it seems as though ive lived my life
on the bad side of the moon
to stir your dregs in sickness still
without the rustic spoon

common people live with me
where the light has never shone
and the hermits flock like hummingbirds
to speak in a foreign tongue

im a light world away
from the people who make me stay
sitting on the bad side of the moon

there aint no need for watchdogs here
to justify our ways
we live our life in manacles
the main cause of our stay

exiled here from other worlds
my sentence comes too soon
why should i be made to pay
on the bad side of the moon


whys it never light on my lawn
why does it rain and never say good day to the new dawn
on the big screen they showed us a sun
but not as bright in life as the real one
its never quite the same as the real one

and tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
to see through eyes that only see whats real
tell me grey seal

i never learned why meteors were formed
i only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
if anyone can cry then so can i
i read books and draw life from the eye
all my life is drawings from the eye

and tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
to see through eyes that only see whats real
tell me grey seal

your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
the roots were formed by twisted roots
your roots were twisted then
i was reborn before all life could die
the phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
if the phoenix bird can fly then so can i

and tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
to see through eyes that only see whats real
tell me grey seal

tell me grey seal how does it feel
tell me grey seal how does it feel
tell me grey seal how does it feel


if anyone should see me making it down the highway
breaking all the laws of the land
well dont you try to stop me
im going her way
and thats the way im sure she had it planned

well thats my rockandroll madonna
shes always been a lady of the road
well everybody wants her
but no one ever gets her
well the freeway is the only way she knows

well if she would only slow down for a short time
id get to know her just before she leaves
but shes got some fascination for that two wheel combination
and i swear its going to be the death of me


its a little bit funny this feeling inside
im not one of those who can easily hide
i dont have much money but boy if i did
id buy a big house where we both could live

if i was a sculptor but then again no
or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
i know its not much but its the best i can do
my gift is my song and this ones for you

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that its done
i hope you dont mind i hope you dont mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while youre in the world

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well a few of the verses well theyve got me quite cross
but the suns been quite kind while i wrote this song
its for people like you that keep it turned on

so excuse me forgetting but these things i do
you see ive forgotten if theyre green or theyre blue
anyway the thing is what i really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes ive ever seen

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that its done
i hope you dont mind i hope you dont mind

at my feeding time
she pushed food through the door
and i crawl towards the crack of light
sometimes i cant find my way
newspapers spread around soaking all that they can
a cleaning is due again a good hosing down

the lady whom i feel maternal love for
can not look me in the eyes
but i see hers and they are blue
and they cock and twitch and masturbate

ah
i said so
i said so
i said so

black windows of paint i scratched with my nails
i see others just like me why do they not try to escape
they bring out the older ones they point in my way
they come with a flash of light and take my family away

and very later i have learned to
accept some friends or ridicule
my whole existence is for your amusement
and that is why im here with you

to take
me with

they make a deal when they come to town

he loves her more than he will ever show

keep the cigarettes close to his heart
keeps her photographs close to her heart
keep the bitterness close to the heart

hates in the city and my loves in the meadow
hands on the plow and my feets in the ghetto

and their babies cry
while cities lie at their feet
when youre rockin the streets

im just a punk in the street


goin under rats in the cellar

new york city blues
east side west side blues
throw me in the slam
catch me if you can
believe
that youre wearin
tearin me apart

safe complaining cause everythings rotten

the street is cold the dawn is gray
my heart says no but my head says stay
my work is finished or so ive been told
you cant part the three of us once we got a hold

i forgot my name
i took a shot on the chin
im rearranging my game
tell by the shape im in

in the line of fire you know what to say
they gave us no choices just one shade of gray
my legs keep moving dont seem to stray
but i know each step we take theyre one step away

i found the secret the key to the vault
we walked in darkness kept hittin the walls
i took the time to feel for the door
i found the secret the key to it all

i got the nouveauree
and dragged it home to bed
i traded you for me
i took it all and said

i find my own fun sometimes for free
i got to pay it to come lookin for me
walking on gucci wearin yves saint laurent
barely stay on cause im so god damn gaunt

i found the secret the key to the vault
we walked in darkness kept hittin the walls
i took the time to feel for the door
i found the secret the key to it all

hey there looking at me
tell me what do you see
but you quickly turn your head away

try to find the words i could use
dont have the courage to come up to you
my chance is looking a bit gray

staring across the room
are you leaving soon
i just need a little time

what is it that drives me mad
girls like you that i never had
what is it about you that i adore

what makes me feel so much pain
that makes me go so insane
what is it about you that i adore

staring across the room
are you leaving soon
i just need a little time

why did you have to leave so soon
why did you have to walk away

oh well it happened again
she walked away with her boyfriend
maybe well meet again someday

maybe well meet again someday
maybe well meet again someday
someday


ill go for miles until i find you
you say you want to leave me but you cant choose
i feel my mind is going insane something i cant fight

dont leave me
dont leave me
dont leave me
dont leave me

a blank expression covering your face
im looking for directions to get out of this place
i start to wonder if youll come back
i feel the rain storming after thunder i cant hold back

dont leave me
dont leave me
dont leave me
dont leave me


looking back upon my life and the places that ive been
the pictures faces girls ive loved i try to remember when
faded memories on the wall some names i have forgotten
but each one is a memory i look back on so often

i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there i was there
i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there i was there

looking back what i have done theres lots more left to live
at times i feel overwhelmed i question what i can give
but i dont let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
theres no doubt about who i am i always have tomorrow

i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there i was there
i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there i was there

looking back upon my life
faded memories upon the wall
looking now at who i am who am i
i dont let it get me down

i was there i was there
i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there i was there


now you see me now you dont dont ask me where im at
cause im a million miles away
treated like a forbidden heel dont say my thoughts are not for real
or you wont see me again

am i here or am i there
or am i playing on the stairs
am i in my room with my toys
i am the disappearing boy

when i walk in crowded rooms i feel as if it is my doom
i know that i dont belong
in that room i see her i see her and shes with him
i turn around and then im gone

dont call me up cause im not home
my whereabouts are now unknown
i vanished from all your joy
i am the disappearing boy

i have my doubts of where i belong
its something to think about

dont call me up cause im not home
my whereabouts are now unknown
i vanished from all your joy
i am the disappearing boy


a small cloud has fallen the white mist hits the ground
my lungs comfort me with joy
vegging on one detail the rest just crowds around
my eyes itch of burning red

picture sounds
of moving insects so surreal
lay around
looks like i found something new

laying in my bed i think im in left field
i picture someone i think its you
youre standing so damn close my body begins to swell
why does one and one make two

here we go again infatuation touches me
just when i thought that it would end
oh but then again it seems much more than that
but im not sure exactly what youre thinking

but to find that its not different at all
well i throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
thats when i say what the hey

would it last forever
you and i together hand and hand we run away far away
im in for nasty weather
but ill take whatever you can give that comes my way far away

of getting older and older all the time
i ask you now what does this mean
are all these problems just in my mind

things are easy when youre a child
but now these pressures are dropped on my head
the length ive gone are just long miles
would they be shorter if i were dead

every time i look in my past
i always wish i was there
i wish my youth would forever last
why are these times so unfair

look at my friends and see what theyve done
ask myself why theyve had to change
i liked them better when they were young
now all these times are rearranged

i look down and stand there and cry
nothing will ever be the same
the sun is rising now i ask why
the clouds are falling here comes the rain

every time i look in my past
i always wish i was there
i wish my youth would forever last
why are these times so unfair

i always waste my time just wondering
what the next man thinks of me
ill never do exactly what i want
and ill sculpt my life for your acceptance

i always waste my time just wondering
what the next man thinks of me
ill never do exactly what i want
and ill sculpt my life for your acceptance

and i feel forgotten feel like rotting
do you feel the same do you feel the same
adolescence just cant make sense
its calling my name its calling my name

i take a look around at all the things ive found
i call it blind hatred
if youd stop awhile and maybe if youd smile
you would realize that were all the same

its just like a brain
when it goes insane
we feel the same pain

all my life ive seemed to have this need
i think at times it even turns to greed
we all want to join this family
well even sacrifice a moral changing

but i feel forgotten feel like rotting
do you feel the same do you feel the same
adolescence just cant make sense
its calling my name its calling my name

hey can you hear me im calling your name
hello or is this goodbye
the gleam in your eyes it troubles my brain

so i can rest my head

angel dancing away
as all of my thoughts get rearranged
angel turning away
just when things seem to have changed

so i can rest my head

hey can you hear me im calling your name
hello or is this goodbye
the gleam in your eyes it troubles my brain
will i see it again

so i can rest my head


princess in a schoolgirls dream may i please speak to you
im having troubles with control and its all because of you
today i kept on falling down i thought it was the street
and so i looked down at my shoes they were on the wrong feet

and i find it hard to be myself can you please explain
and i do not think that its my health youre the one to blame
youre the one i wish i had and now my girlfriends getting mad
i cannot call this sane i cannot call this sane

today as i was walking down you bumped into me
you said excuse me and walked away as i dropped to my knees
i prayed to the being in the sky that my parents told me of
i asked about you but no reply no clues about your love

and i find it hard to be myself can you please explain
and i do not think that its my health youre the one to blame
my girlfriend left me on the phone im pathetically left here alone
i cannot call this sane i cannot call this sane

so that you can stay

i sit alone in my bedroom
staring at the walls
my pulse is speeding my breath is short and

i hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
cause shes  light years away
she holds my malachite so tight so never let go
cause shes  light years away

i sit outside and watch the sun rise
look out as far as i can
i cant see her but in the distance
i hear some laughter we laugh together

i hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
cause shes  light years away
she holds my malachite so tight so never let go
cause shes  light years away

i sit alone in my bedroom
staring at the walls
my pulse is speeding my breath is short and

i hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
cause shes  light years away
she holds my malachite so tight so never let go
cause shes  light years away


juliets trying to find out what she wants but she dont know
experience has got her down
well look this direction i know its not perfection its just me

open up your worried world and let me in

juliets crying well now shes realizing love can be
filled with pain and distrust
i know i am crazy and a bit lazy
but i will try to bring you up again somehow

cause im losing whats left of my dignity

dear mother can you hear me whining
its been three whole weeks since i have left your home
this sudden fear has left me trembling
cause now it seems that i am out here on my own and im feeling so alone

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

a gunshot rings out at the station
another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
it makes me wonder why im still here
for some strange reason its now feeling like my own and im never gonna go

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

dear mother can you hear me laughing
its been six whole months since i have left your home
it makes me wonder why im still here
for some strange reason its now feeling like my own and im never gonna go

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise whoa paradise


staring out of my window watching the cars go rolling by
my friends are gone ive got nothing to do
so i sit here patiently watching the clock tick so slowly
gotta get away or my brains will explode

give me something to do to kill some time
take me to that place that i call home
take away the strains of being lonely
take me to the tracks at christie road

see the hills from afar standing on my beatup car
now i feel like me once again as the train comes arolling in
smoked my boredom gone slapped my brains up so high

give me something to do to kill some time
take me to that place that i call home
take away the strains of being lonely
take me to the tracks at christie road

mother stay out of my way
of that place we go
well always seem to find our way
to christie road

mother stay out of my way
of that place we go
well always seem to find our way
to christie road

if theres one thing that i need
that makes me feel complete
so i go to christie road
its home its home


i wander down these streets all by myself
think of my future now i just dont know
or i dont seem to care

i stop to notice that im by your home
i wonder if youre sitting all alone
or is your boyfriend there

because i feel so right
let my imagination go
until youre in my sights
and through my veins temptation flows

so i sit down here on the hard concrete
think of my future now i just dont know
or i dont seem to care

i stop to notice that im by your home
i wonder if youre sitting all alone
or is your boyfriend there

because i feel so right
let my imagination go
until youre in my sights
and through my veins temptation flows

because i feel so right
let my imagination go
until youre in my sights
and through my veins temptation flows


i want to be your dominated love slave
i want to be the one that takes the pain
you can spank me when i do not behave
smack me in the forehead with a chain

cause i love feeling dirty
and i love feeling cheap
and i love it when you hurt me
so drive those staples deep

i want you to slap me and call me naughty
put a belt sander against my skin
want to feel pain all over my body
cant wait to be punished for my sins

i love feeling dirty
and i love feeling cheap
and i love it when you hurt me
so drive those staples deep

i love feeling dirty
and i love feeling cheap
and i love it when you hurt me
so drive staples


when i was younger i thought that the world circled around me
but in time i realized i was so wrong
my immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
it was a tragic case of my reality

do you think youre indestructible
and no one can touch you
well i think youre disposable
and its time you knew the truth

cause its just one of my lies
well its just one of my lies
and all i want to do is get real high
well its just one of my lies

why does my life have to be so small and death is forever
and does forever have a life to call its own
dont give me an answer cause you only know as much as i know
unless youre been there once hell i hardly think so

do you think youre indestructible
and no one can touch you
well i think youre disposable
and its time you knew the truth

cause its just one of my lies
well its just one of my lies
and all i wanna do is get real high
well its just one of my lies

before i lay myself down
my mother said it was right
her mother set it down  why


my mental stability reaches its bitter end
and all my senses are coming unglued
is there any cure for this disease someone called love
not as long as there are girls like you

everything she does questions my mental health
it makes me lose control i want to hurt myself

if anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated

sometimes i wonder if i should be left alone
or lock myself up in a padded room
id sit and spew my guts out to the open air
cause no one wants to hear a drunken fool

everything she does questions my mental health
it makes me lose control i just cant trust myself

if anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated

i do not mind if this goes on
cause now it seems im too far gone
i must admit that i enjoy myself
 please keep taking me away away

everything she does questions my mental health
it makes me lose control i just cant trust myself

if anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated


hey old man in womans shoes
i wonder if he knows i think hes crazy
when he was young did he have dreams of
wearing womens shoes and being crazy

it makes me wonder when i grow to be that age
will i be walking down the street begging for your spare change
or will i grow that old will i still be around
the way i carry on ill end up six feet underground and waste away

when the old man was in school
did the golden rules make him go crazy
or did he hide away from hopes
behind a smile and smoking dope its crazy

it makes me wonder when i grow to be that age
will i be walking down the street begging for your spare change
or will i grow that old will i still be around
the way i carry on ill end up six feet underground and waste away

and it seems so frightening time passes by like lightning
before you know it youre struck down
i always waste my time on my chemical emotions
it keeps my head spinning around waste away

and it seems so frightening time passes by like lightning
before you know it youre struck down
i always waste my time on my chemical emotions
it keeps my head spinning around waste away


why should my fun have to end
for me its only the beginning
i see my friends begin to age
a short countdown to their end

call me irresponsible call me habitual
but when you think of me
do you fill your head with schemes
better think again cause no one knows

i dont want to cause no harm
but sometimes my actions hurt
is there something i should find
to make plans for forever

call me irresponsible call me habitual
but when you think of me
do you fill your head with schemes
better think again cause no one knows

call me irresponsible call me habitual
but when you think of me
do you fill your head with schemes
better think again cause no one knows

does it seem like all your memories fade
you soak up knowledge to fill the space
and still my answer remains
i dont know


a thought burst in my head and i need to tell you
its news that i forethought
was it just a dream that happened long ago
i think i just forgot

well it hasnt been the first time
and it sure does drive me mad

thats when i say theres a boy who fogs his world and now hes getting lazy
theres no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting

i shuffle through my mind to see if i can find
the words i left behind
was it just a dream that happened long ago
oh well never mind

well it hasnt been the first time
and it sure does drive me mad

thats when i say theres a boy who fogs his world and now hes getting lazy
theres no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting

thats when i say theres a boy who fogs his world and now hes getting lazy
theres no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting

theres a boy who fogs his world and now hes getting lazy
theres no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting


now it seems i cant keep my mind of you
my brain drifts back to better days weve been through
like sitting on blacktops of the school grounds

but now its gone
and i take the blame
but theres nothing i can do but take the pain
why

now i dwell on what you remind me of
a sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
as for me i am blind without a cause
and now i realize what i have lost

it was something real
that i could have had
now i play the fool whose stable souls gone bad
why

tell me worlds of words i might have said
its pumping pressure deep inside my head
was it bad enough to be too late
just tell me the words i might have ate

the words i might have ate
the words i might have ate

but now its gone
and i take the blame
but theres nothing i can do but take the pain
why

why
why
why
oh why
why
why


sweet young girl so soft and blonde
does exactly what shes been warned
intoxications in her veins
sweet young boy plays with her brain

believing all his pain filled lies
putting his hands onto her thighs
her purity has now been ripped
he takes it away and then he says

sweet children
sweet children
sweet children
well never win

johnny rays running scared
as the end is drawing near
running from the light of day
or maybe lie and celebrate

the slightest urge goes from his hands
follow me if you understand
hes got the trigger on his gun
final sin and now he runs

sweet children
sweet children
sweet children
well never win

sweet children
sweet children
sweet children
well never win


come with me and lets go for a ride
follow me out to the other side
as i sit around and watch you pout
cause i know that youre the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around

running wild and always running free
exploring things that i have never seen
hearing colors and all i see are sounds
now i know that youre the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around

im seeing faces of mysteries of the earth
i am not one with the aggressions of my birth
or go to stance or hallucinations i cant find
a missing piece of the thought thats in my mind

come with me and lets go for a ride
follow me out to the other side
as i sit around and watch you pout
cause i know that youre the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around

running wild and always running free
exploring things that i have never seen
hearing colors and all i see are sounds
now i know that youre the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around


looking out through clouds in the sky
floating image in my mind
land of beauty and land of grace
now i wonder where this place is from

the average person is everywhere
i got a job and now im scared
strange beings all around
come everyone to this place ive found

evidence is everywhere
i start to run now im scared
strange beings all around
everyone come to this place ive found

i feel what its like to be wanted
and wonder why
unlocked doors will be open
no more cries

my eyes are clear and now im cured
dont you want to be for sure
i know my rights im allowed to die
so id rather swap your different guise

its in my head that you will find
mother love from all mankind
you look above and then you shout
no other way to say your head is right

i feel what its like to be wanted
and wonder why
unlocked doors will be open
no more cries

i feel what its like to be wanted
and wonder why
unlocked doors will be open
no more cries


i think i can do who


my generation







i declare i dont care no more
im burning up and out and growing bored
in my smoked out boring room

my hair is shagging in my eyes

im not growing up im just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

apathy has rained on me
now im feeling like a soggy dream
so close to drowning but i dont mind

ive lived in this mental cave
throw my emotions in the grave
hell who needs them anyway

im not growing up im just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
im not growing up im just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

im not growing up im just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
im not growing up im just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead


im taking all you down with me
explosives duct taped to my spine
nothings gonna change my mind

i wont listen to anyones last words
theres nothing left for you to say
soon youll be dead anyway

well no one here is getting out alive
this time ive really lost my mind and i dont care
so close your eyes
and kiss yourself goodbye
and think about the times you spent and what theyve meant

to me its nothing
to me its nothing
to me its nothing
to me its nothing

im losing all my happiness
the happiness you pinned on me
loneliness still comforts me
my anger dwells inside of me

well no one here is getting out alive
this time ive really lost my mind and i dont care
so close your eyes
and kiss yourself goodbye
and think about the times you spent and what theyve meant

to me its nothing
to me its nothing
to me its nothing
to me its nothing

do you ever think back to another time
does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind
do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
do you ever build up all the small things in your head
to make one problem that adds up to nothing

to me its nothing
to me its nothing
to me its nothing


i dont know you but i think i hate you
youre the reason for my misery
strange how youve become my biggest enemy
and ive never even seen your face

well maybe its just jealousy
mixing up with a violent mind
a circumstance that doesnt make much sense
or maybe im just dumb

youre the cloud hanging out over my head
hail comes crashing down welting my face
magic man egocentric plastic man
yet you still got one over on me

maybe its just jealousy
mixing up with a violent mind
a circumstance that doesnt make much sense
or maybe im just dumb

im a chump


i sit around and watch the tube but nothings on
i change the channels for an hour or two
twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
in a house with unlocked doors

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
im so damn bored im goin blind

peel me off this velcro seat and get me movin
i sure as hell cant do it by myself
im feelin like a dog in heat
barred indoors from the summer street
i locked the door to my own cell and i lost the key

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
im so damn bored im goin blind

i got no motivation
where is my motivation
no time for the motivation
smokin my inspiration
huah

i sit around and watch the phone but no ones callin
call me pathetic call me what you will
my mother says to get a job
but she dont like the one shes got
when masturbations lost its fun
suh

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
im so damn bored im goin blind
and loneliness has to suffice

bite my lip and close my eyes

mountain of mystery
rising high above the clouds
mountain of magic
standin tall and proud
your magical veins flowing silver and gold
your cumulus cloud glows misty red
as apollo sets beyond your head

releasing the pressure built over the years
the mountain is crying hot lava tears
molten rock created under
vibrations of subterranean thunder
ejecting boulders like pieces of sand
the mountain is giving birth to the land
birth to the land

under your feet you feel a rumble
as thousands of rocks
are starting to tumble
above the trees where the buzzard flies
swirling vapors begin to rise
beneath those misty peaks you hide
a tremendous force boiling deep inside

guilty as charged but damn it it aint right
theres someone else controlling me
death in the air strapped in the electric chair
this cant be happening to me

who made you god to say
ill take your life from you

flash before my eyes
now its time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame

wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
its the beginning of the end
sweat chilling cold as i watch death unfold
consciousness my only friend

my fingers grip with fear
what am i doing here

flash before my eyes
now its time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame

someone help me oh please god help me
theyre trying to take it all away
i dont want to die

someone help me oh please god help me
theyre trying to take it all away
i dont want to die

time moving slow the minutes seem like hours
the final curtain all i see
how true is this just get it over with
if this is true just let it be

wakened by horrid scream
freed from this frightening dream

flash before my eyes
now its time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame


make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun on they run through the endless grey
on they fight for the right yes but whos to say
for a hill men would kill why they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men of five still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know

for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls

take a look to the sky just before you die
its the last time he will
blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
he hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn all is gone except the will to be
now they see what will be blinded eyes to see

for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls


life it seems will fade away
drifting further every day
getting lost within myself
nothing matters no one else

i have lost the will to live
simply nothing more to give
there is nothing more for me
need the end to set me free

things not what they used to be
missing one inside of me
deathly loss this cant be real
cannot stand this hell i feel

emptiness is filling me
to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn
i was me but now hes gone

no one but me can save myself but its too late
now i cant think think why i should even try

yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greets me warm now i will just say goodbye
goodbye


i dont know how to live through this hell
woken up im still locked in this shell
frozen soul frozen down to the core
break the ice i cant take anymore

freezing cant move at all
screaming cant hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out im trapped under ice

crystallized as i lay here and rest
eyes of glass stare directly at death
from deep sleep i have broken away
no one knows no one hears what i say

freezing cant move at all
screaming cant hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out im trapped under ice

scream from my soul
fate mystified
hell forever more
scream from my soul
fate mystified
hell forever more

no release from my cryonic state
what is this ive been stricken by fate
wrapped up tight cannot move cant break free
hand of doom has a tight grip on me

freezing cant move at all
screaming cant hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out im trapped under ice
freezing cant move at all
screaming cant hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out im trapped under ice


feel no pain but my life aint easy
i know im my best friend
no one cares but im so much stronger
ill fight until the end

to escape from the true false world
undamaged destiny
cant get caught in the endless circle
ring of stupidity

out for my own out to be free
one with my mind they just cant see
no need to hear things that they say
lifes for my own to live my own way

dont tell me what to do
i dont care now cause im on my side
and i can see through you

feed my brain with your so called standards
who says that i aint right
break away from your common fashion
see through your blurry sight

out for my own out to be free
one with my mind they just cant see
no need to hear things that they say
lifes for my own to live my own way

see them try to bring the hammer down
no damn chains can hold me to the ground

lifes for my own to live my own way
lifes for my own to live my own way
lifes for my own to live my own way
lifes for my own to live my own way

lifes for my own to live my own way
lifes for my own to live my own way
lifes for my own to live my own way

lashing out the action returning the reaction
weak are ripped and torn away
hypnotizing power crushing all that cower
battery is here to stay

smashing through the boundaries lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family battery is found in me
battery

crushing all deceivers mashing nonbelievers
never ending potency
hungry violence seeker feeding off the weaker
breeding on insanity

smashing through the boundaries lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family battery is found in me
battery

circle of destruction hammer comes crushing
powerhouse of energy
whipping up a fury dominating flurry
we create the battery

smashing through the boundaries lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family battery is found in me

veins that pump with fear sucking darkest clear
leading on your deaths construction

dedicated to
how im killing you

come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master

twisting your mind smashing your dreams
blinded by me you cant see a thing
just call my name cause ill hear you scream
master master
just call my name cause ill hear you scream
master master

needlework the way never you betray
life of death becoming clearer
pain monopoly ritual misery
chop your breakfast on a mirror

taste me you will see
more is all you need
dedicated to
how im killing you

come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master

master of puppets im pulling your strings
twisting your mind smashing your dreams
blinded by me you cant see a thing
just call my name cause ill hear you scream
master master
just call my name cause ill hear you scream
master master

master master
master master

master master
wheres the dreams that ive been after
master master
promised only lies
laughter laughter
all i hear and see is laughter
laughter laughter
laughing at my cries
fix me

hell is worth all that natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
neverending maze drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season

i will occupy
i will help you die
i will run through you
now i rule you too

come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master

master of puppets im pulling your strings
twisting your mind smashing your dreams
blinded by me you cant see a thing
just call my name cause ill hear you scream
master master
just call my name cause ill hear you scream
master master


messenger of fear in sight
dark deception kills the light

hybrid children watch the sea
pray for father roaming free

fearless wretch insanity
he watches lurking beneath the sea
great old one forbidden site
he searches hunter of the shadows is rising

immortal
in madness you dwell

crawling chaos underground
cult has summoned twisted sound

out from ruins once possessed
fallen city living death

fearless wretch insanity
he watches lurking beneath the sea
timeless sleep has been upset
he awakens hunter of the shadows is rising

immortal
in madness you dwell

in madness you dwell

not dead which eternal lie
stranger eons death may die

drain you of your sanity
face the thing that should not be

fearless wretch insanity
he watches lurking beneath the sea
great old one forbidden site
he searches hunter of the shadows is rising

immortal
in madness you dwell


welcome to where time stands still
no one leaves and no one will
moon is full never seems to change
just labelled mentally deranged
i see our freedom in my sight
no locked doors no windows barred
no things to make my brain seem scarred

sleep my friend and you will see
that dream is my reality
they keep me locked up in this cage
cant they see its why my brain says rage

sanitarium leave me be
sanitarium just leave me alone

build my fear of whats out there
cannot breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that im insane
they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
keep him tied it makes him well
hes getting better cant you tell

no more can they keep us in
listen damn it we will win
they see it right they see it well
but they think this saves us from our hell

sanitarium leave me be
sanitarium just leave me alone
sanitarium just leave me alone

fear of living on
natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air
got some death to do
mirror stares back hard
kill its such a friendly word
seems the only way
for reaching out again


bodies fill the fields i see hungry heroes end
no one to play soldier now no one to pretend
running blind through killing fields bred to kill them all
victim of what said should be a servant till i fall

soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
twentyone only son but he served us well
bred to kill not to care do just as we say
finished here greetings death hes yours to take away

back to the front you will do what i say when i say
back to the front you will die when i say you must die
back to the front you coward you servant you blind man

barking of machinegun fire does nothing to me now
sounding of the clock that ticks get used to it somehow
more a man more stripes you wear gloryseeker trends
bodies fill the fields i see the slaughter never ends

soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
twentyone only son but he served us well
bred to kill not to care do just as we say
finished here greetings death hes yours to take away

back to the front you will do what i say when i say
back to the front you will die when i say you must die
back to the front you coward you servant you blind man

why am i dying
kill have no fear
lie live off lying
hell hell is here

why am i dying
kill have no fear
lie live off lying
hell hell is here
i was born for dying

life planned out before my birth nothing could i say
had no chance to see myself moulded day by day
looking back i realize nothing have i done
left to die with only friend alone i clench my gun

soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
twentyone only son but he served us well
bred to kill not to care do just as we say
finished here greetings death hes yours to take away

back to the front you will do what i say when i say
back to the front you will die when i say you must die
back to the front you coward you servant you blind man back to the front

back to the front
back to the front
back to the front
back to the front


one two
one two three four five

spineless from the start
sucked into the part
circus comes to town
you play the lead clown

please please
spreading his disease living by his story
knees knees
falling to your knees suffer for his glory
you will

time for lust time for lie
time to kiss your life goodbye
send me money send me green heaven you will meet
make a contribution and youll get the better seat
bow to leper messiah

marvel at his tricks
need your sunday fix
blind devotion came
rotting your brain

chain chain
join the endless chain taken by his glamour
fame fame
infection is the game stinking drunk with power
we see

time for lust time for lie
time to kiss your life goodbye
send me money send me green heaven you will meet
make a contribution and youll get the better seat
bow to leper messiah

witchery weakening
see the sheep are gathering
set the trap hypnotize
now you follow

time for lust time for lie
time to kiss your life goodbye
send me money send me green heaven you will meet
make a contribution and youll get the better seat

lie lie lie lie
lie lie lie lie


dealing out the agony within
charging hard and no ones going to give in
living on your knees conformity
or dying on your feet for honesty

inbred our bodies work as one
bloody but never cry submission
following our instinct not a trend
go against the grain until the end

blood will follow blood
dying time is here
damage incorporated

stepping out youll feel our hell on your back
blood follows blood and we make sure
life aint for you and were the cure

honesty is my only excuse
try to rob us of it but its no use
steamroller action crushing all
victim is your name and you shall fall

blood will follow blood
dying time is here
damage incorporated

we chew and spit you out
we laugh you scream and shout
all flee with fear you run
youll know just where we come from
damage incorporated
go

damage jackals ripping right through you
sight and smell of this it gets me going
know just how to get just what we want

never happy endings on these dark sets
alls fair for damage inc you see
step a little closer if you please

blood will follow blood
dying time is here
damage incorporated

maybe ill slay a dragon for you
or banish wicked giants from the land
but you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you

war made him a soldier
little frankie mear
peace left him a loser
the little bombardier

lines of worry appeared with age
unskilled hands that knew no trade
spent his time in the picture house
the little bombardier

frankie drank his money
the little that he made
told his woes to no man
friendless lonely days

then one day in the abc
four bright eyes gazed longingly
at the icecream in the hand of
the little bombardier

sunshine entered our frankies days
gone his worries his hopeless maze
his life was fun and his heart was full of joy

two young children had changed his aims
he gave them toffees and played their games
he brought them presents with every coin he made

then two gentlemen called on him
asked him for his name
why was he friends with the children
were they just a game

leave them alone or well get sore
weve had blokes like you in the station before
the hand of authority said no more to
the little bombardier

packed his bags his heart in pain
wiped a tear and caught a train
not to be seen in the town again
the little bombardier


mountains of lhasa are feeling the rain
people are walking the potala lanes
preacher takes the school
one boy breaks a rule

silly boy blue blue
silly boy blue

yak butter statues that melt in the sun
cannot dissolve all the work youve not done
a chela likes to feel
that his overself pays the bill

silly boy blue blue
silly boy blue

you wish and wish and wish again
youve tried so hard to fly
youll never leave your body now
youve got to wait to die

la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
silly boy blue blue
silly boy blue

child of tibet youre a gift from the sun
reincarnation of one better man
the homeward road is long
youve left your prayers and song

silly boy blue
silly boy blue

smiling girls and rosy boys
come and buy my little toys
monkeys made of gingerbread
and sugar horses painted red

rich mens children running past
their fathers dressed in hose
golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
gazing eyes and running wild
past the stocks and over stiles
kiss the window merry child
but come and buy my toys

youve watched your father plough the fields with a rams horn
sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
reaped it with a sharpened scyth threashed it with a quill
the miller told your father that hed work it with the greatest will
now your watchings over you must play with girls and boys
leave the parsley on the stalls
come and buy my toys

you shall own a cambric shirt
you shall work your fathers land
but now you shall play in the market square
till youll be a man

smiling girls and rosy boys
come and buy my little toys
monkeys made of gingerbread
and sugar horses painted red


let me introduce you to the gang
johnny plays the sitar hes an existentialist
once he had a name now he plays our game
you wont feel so good now that youve joined the gang

molly is the model in the ads
crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
someone switched her on then her beam went wrong
cause she cant switch off now that shes joined the gang

arthur is a singer with a band
arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
look at arthur rave all the kids are paid
they want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

you wont be alone weve all got beery grins
its a big illusion but at least youre in
at least youre in

this clubs called the webb its this months pick
next month we shall find a place where prices arent so stiff
 bob a coke fraid thats past a joke
this is how to spend now that youve joined the gang

this is what to do now that youre here
sit round doing nothing all together very fast
psychedelic stars throwing down cigars
theyre picking up the joints now that theyve joined the gang


shed walk through the door and shed set up the drinks on the house
she played a good game of darts and the men slapped her back
and never took her out
she wore a trench coat khaki
her hobnail boots were full of holes
shes got medals

her mother called her mary but she changed her name to tommy
shes a one oh
she went and joined the army
passed the medical dont ask me how its done
they sent her to the front line
fighting for her countrys name
shes got medals

she got very tired of picking up girls
cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
then the enemy dropped a bomb
survivors there were none

people say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
you can see her ghost but thats a lie because the naughty woman isnt dead
shed deserted on the previous morning
replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
called herself eileen
came to london town
now shes settled down
shes got medals


this girl is made of lipstick
powder and paint
sees the pictures of herself
every magazine on every shelf

this girl is maid of bond street
hailing cabs lunches with executives
gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

this girl is a lonely girl
takes the train from paddington to oxford circus
buys the daily news
but passengers dont smile at her dont smile at her

this girl is made of loneliness
a broken heart
for the boy that she once knew
doesnt want to know her any more

and this girl is a lonely girl
every thing she wants is hers
but she cant make it with the boy she really wants to be with
all the time to love all the time

this boy is made of envy
jealousy
he doesnt have a limousine
really wants to be a star himself

this girl her world is made of flashlights and films
her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

and maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
maids of bond street picture clothes eyes of stars
maids of bond street shouldnt have worldly cares
maids of bond street shouldnt have love affairs


theres a little churchyard just along the way
it used to be lambeths finest array
of tombstones epitaphs wreaths flowers all that jazz
till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

and in this little yard theres a little old man
with a little shovel in his little bitty hand
he seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
he hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home

ahchoo excuse me

please mr gravedigger dont feel ashamed
as you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
please mr gravedigger i couldnt care
if you found a golden locket full of some girls hair
and you put it in your pocket

god its pouring down

her mother doesnt know about your sentimental joy
she thinks its down below with the rest of her toys
and ma wouldnt understand so i wont tell
so keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

yes mr gd you see me every day
standing in the same spot by a certain grave
maryann was only  full of life and oh so gay
and i was the wicked man who took her life away
very selfish oh god

no mr gd you wont tell
and just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
ive started digging holes my friend
and this one heres for you

lifted our girl she apparently doesnt know of it
hello misses thought shed be a little girl
bloody obscene catch pneumonia or something in this rain

smiling girls and rosy boys
come and buy my little toys
monkeys made of gingerbread
and sugar horses painted red

rich mens children running past
their fathers dressed in hose
golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
gazing eyes and running wild
past the stocks and over stiles
kiss the window merry child
but come and buy my toys

youve watched your father plough the fields with a rams horn
sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
reaped it with a sharpened scyth threashed it with a quill
the miller told your father that hed work it with the greatest will
now your watchings over you must play with girls and boys
leave the parsley on the stalls
come and buy my toys

you shall own a cambric shirt
you shall work your fathers land
but now you shall play in the market square
till youll be a man

smiling girls and rosy boys
come and buy my little toys
monkeys made of gingerbread
and sugar horses painted red


let me introduce you to the gang
johnny plays the sitar hes an existentialist
once he had a name now he plays our game
you wont feel so good now that youve joined the gang

molly is the model in the ads
crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
someone switched her on then her beam went wrong
cause she cant switch off now that shes joined the gang

arthur is a singer with a band
arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
look at arthur rave all the kids are paid
they want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

you wont be alone weve all got beery grins
its a big illusion but at least youre in
at least youre in

this clubs called the webb its this months pick
next month we shall find a place where prices arent so stiff
 bob a coke fraid thats past a joke
this is how to spend now that youve joined the gang

this is what to do now that youre here
sit round doing nothing all together very fast
psychedelic stars throwing down cigars
theyre picking up the joints now that theyve joined the gang


shed walk through the door and shed set up the drinks on the house
she played a good game of darts and the men slapped her back
and never took her out
she wore a trench coat khaki
her hobnail boots were full of holes
shes got medals

her mother called her mary but she changed her name to tommy
shes a one oh
she went and joined the army
passed the medical dont ask me how its done
they sent her to the front line
fighting for her countrys name
shes got medals

she got very tired of picking up girls
cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
then the enemy dropped a bomb
survivors there were none

people say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
you can see her ghost but thats a lie because the naughty woman isnt dead
shed deserted on the previous morning
replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
called herself eileen
came to london town
now shes settled down
shes got medals


this girl is made of lipstick
powder and paint
sees the pictures of herself
every magazine on every shelf

this girl is maid of bond street
hailing cabs lunches with executives
gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

this girl is a lonely girl
takes the train from paddington to oxford circus
buys the daily news
but passengers dont smile at her dont smile at her

this girl is made of loneliness
a broken heart
for the boy that she once knew
doesnt want to know her any more

and this girl is a lonely girl
every thing she wants is hers
but she cant make it with the boy she really wants to be with
all the time to love all the time

this boy is made of envy
jealousy
he doesnt have a limousine
really wants to be a star himself

this girl her world is made of flashlights and films
her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

and maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
maids of bond street picture clothes eyes of stars
maids of bond street shouldnt have worldly cares
maids of bond street shouldnt have love affairs


theres a little churchyard just along the way
it used to be lambeths finest array
of tombstones epitaphs wreaths flowers all that jazz
till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

and in this little yard theres a little old man
with a little shovel in his little bitty hand
he seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
he hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home

ahchoo excuse me

please mr gravedigger dont feel ashamed
as you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
please mr gravedigger i couldnt care
if you found a golden locket full of some girls hair
and you put it in your pocket

god its pouring down

her mother doesnt know about your sentimental joy
she thinks its down below with the rest of her toys
and ma wouldnt understand so i wont tell
so keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

yes mr gd you see me every day
standing in the same spot by a certain grave
maryann was only  full of life and oh so gay
and i was the wicked man who took her life away
very selfish oh god

no mr gd you wont tell
and just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
ive started digging holes my friend
and this one heres for you

lifted our girl she apparently doesnt know of it
hello misses thought shed be a little girl
bloody obscene catch pneumonia or something in this rain


in the corner of the morning in the past
i would sit and blame the master first and last
all the roads were straight and narrow
and the prayers were small and yellow
and the rumour spread that i was aging fast
then i ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
and i looked and frowned and the monster was me

well i said hello and i said hello
and i asked why not and i replied i dont know
so we asked a simple black bird who was happy as can be
and he laughed insane and quipped kahlil gibran
so i cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
for i realized that gods a young man too

so i said so long and i waved byebye
and i smashed my soul and traded my mind
got laid by a young bordello
who was vaguely half asleep
for which my reputation swept back home in drag
and the moral of this magic spell
negotiates my hide
when god did take my logic for a ride

he swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
and showed me the leather belt round his hips
my knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
he said youll never go down to the gods again

he struck the ground a cavern appeared
and i smelt the burning pit of fear
we crashed a thousand yards below
i said do it again do it again

his nebulous body swayed above
his tongue swollen with devils love
the snake and i a venom high
i said do it again do it again

breathe breathe breathe deeply
and i was seething breathing deeply
spitting sentry horned and tailed
waiting for you

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


day after day
they send my friends away
to mansions cold and grey
to the far side of town
where the thin men stalk the streets
while the sane stay underground

day after day
they tell me i can go
they tell me i can blow
to the far side of town
where its pointless to be high
cause its such a long way down
so i tell them that

i can fly i will scream
i will break my arm
i will do me harm
here i stand
foot in hand
talking to my wall
im not quite right at all
am i

dont set me free
im as heavy as can be
just my librium and me
and my est makes three

cause id rather stay here
with all the madmen
than perish with the sad men roaming free
and id rather play here
with all the madmen
for im quite content theyre all as sane as me

when a nation hides
its organic minds
in a cellar
dark and grim
they must be very dim

day after day
they take some brain away
then turn my face around
to the far side of town
and tell me that its real
then ask me how i feel

here i stand
foot in hand
talking to my wall
im not quite right at all

dont set me free
im as helpless as can be
my libidos split on me
gimme some good ole lobotomy

cause id rather stay here
with all the madmen
than perish with the sad men
roaming free
and id rather play here
with all the madmen
for im quite content
theyre all as sane as me

watching from a post up high
from where you see the ships afar
from a welltrained eye
the waves all keep on crashing by
if you are the light post
then you own the working class
but if you want the answers
you better give a piece of ass
give a piece of your ass

warning post hypnotic suggestions
running the ships ashore
the orange light that follows
will soon proclaim itself a god
if you point your questions
the fog will surely chew you up
but if you want the answers
you better get ready for the fire
get ready for the fire

the ships are multiplying day after day sir
and theyre coming close to the shore sir shore sir
we need to evacuate the light post
its all over its all over
its all over

remember the girl

she finally left him had enough of her mans rage
bandaids cover her scars she left him blooded
beat his ass with a bat face sunk in like silly putty
yall can sit back so i can study
destruction of the family design
and how the morals of society decline

its alright were in love
cant live with or without

you see she cant live with him and cant live without him
stress got her down she needs to deal with her problems
as the drama gets deeper i put on the reefer
took the last step and sent his ass to the reefer
chaos is what she saw in the mirror
scared of herself and the power that was in her
it took over and weighed heavily on her shoulder
militant insanity is now what controlled her

its alright were in love
cant live with or without
its alright were in love
cant live with or without


kill it
before it reaches you
missiles wont work its approaching the mainland
what if it reaches the metropolitan areas cosmopolitan areas
secure the lines and prepare for departure calm calm calm
it is a big business and seems to be advanicng underground
cause my style is underground
im green with my red eyes mad tint
flee fly flow rapido rapido
she feeds plentiful

dont you see that we are in danger
how will we stop it


running out were running out

its alright were in love
cant live with or without


i want to let you in on a story
that i got to tell
about good dreams in heaven not
bad dreams in hell
started with punk rock
and then evolved to hip hop
the party popped off
like the fireworks on my block
alonzo is the street that i take dweel
a little white trash
and a little bit swell
i take you back
and take a step down
july was the month
i was born  pounds
my bad side
my sign is leo defraud the hoax with a ruby
king of the jungle yet i try to be humble
but i should to let yall know what im about
attack your brain fast drop knowledge
the im out im a freak but i got some class
and you can bring the grass
have a session
good times is the lesson
the men will cease fire and
the girls could stop stressin
come on baby doll please jerk me off
perverted state of mind
baby help me get my nut off
whats wrong girly
dont know the art of a quicky
my balls hang low
and they produce something icky
from my dick to your skin
hands rub it in
i know you love lotion baby
thats how i begin
sexual feeding in my dreams
she was screaming down on her knees
as she eating on my seamen
ive this problem
i dont wanna say
but to tell you the truth everybody
i be doing it every day
you may think im stupid
you may think im queer
but to tell you the truth everybody
jackin off is better than beer
my bad side


as i look at the picture
of jacoby smoking broccoli
props to refer
props to bible prophecies
its clearly
evident relationship is permanent
so my mind can be the evidence
ive made my choice
theres no looking back
life long commitment to my second half
hard times good times
two ways to go
ive got my problems
god only knows
it came faster than a blink of an eye
fire rain indapendce th of july
give in give into tradition
one thing id like to say is
my independence day
is wiped from my face
maybe i gave it away
maybe ive got a secret hiding place
i love you
i married you


i could hear myself clear
from the living room
ruptured pain to fear
familys dyin soon
look in my eye what do you see
lover y amigo tambien enemy
because the best thing is life
is for me to sing these words
all i leave at the shows
are chrome microphone turds
i take fat hits
i cap on the girls
who give out  thigh splits
yo all i want is respect
in this game
cause the papa roach style is wild
and not plain
know what im saying
put us through your speakers
cause i know that we are banging
positivity and negativity
we saying that you
cant get the ying
without the yang
confidence and style
mix it up with some slang
and make it grimy
step up was up
i came to make friends to the end
and back again
and show your stacks again
because sometimes im xrated
sometimes im grated
sometimes i bugded crowds
act wild
and get faded
whether its monday
or tuesday
or thursday
or friday
im getting down
everyday
because its my way
to express the onion hardcore slang
a boogedy bang bang
boogedy bang bang
sha bang you know what im saying
put us through your speakers
cause i know we are banging
look in my eyes
what do you see
lover y amigo
tambien enemy
the good and the bad
le bein a le mal
chaos forever
natural law


i am a mess
i made a huge mess
i cant control myself

i kill the rhyme again
im comin sick and on time again
words manifest from deep inside where people hide within
its chemical
unbalanced on the triple beam what
its about what i seen
i seen it happen
back hand brand to face smackin
definite disorder now his mindset is blackened
the doctors say he got the brain of a murderer
this rugged style steals your brain

my heart is bleeding
and this pain it will not pass
its not receding
and my bodys going numb
a bad trip child
rolling stoned keeping high
he dont know what hes doing
he just keeps getting by
thrown away
i want to be thrown away

hes born sick
nothing in his hands but his dick
he couldnt handle pressure
for the life he was leading led him down the wrong path
where guns blast
dont want to talk to the counselor doctor
to tell him whats real
to tell him whats proper
situations unclear like gray
and i know it gets worse everyday

my heart is bleeding
and this pain will not pass
its not receding
and my bodys going numb
a bad trip child
rolling stoned keeping high
he dont know what hes doing
he just keep getting by away
thrown away
i want to be thrown away

i am a mess
ive made a huge mess
i cant control myself
im losing it
ive lost it
ive spilt all my marbles

cause i see you inside of me
sometimes i want to be thrown away

cause i see you inside of me
sometimes i want to be thrown away

a hyper spaz and that is me
sometimes i want to be thrown away

thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away

voices in my head
voices in my head

dont tell me to do it cause i will no

voices in my head
voices in my head

cut my life into pieces
this is my last resort suffocation no breathing
this is my last resort

cut my life into pieces
ive reached my last resort suffocation no breathing
do you even care if i die bleeding
would it be wrong would it be right
mutilation out of sight
and im contemplating suicide

cause im losing my sight losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine
losing my sight losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine

i never realized i was spread too thin
till it was too late and i was empty within
hungry feeding on chaos and living in sin
downward spiral where do i begin
it all started when i lost my mother
no love for myself and no love from another
searching to find a lover on a higher level
finding nothing but questions and devils

cause im losing my sight losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine
losing my sight losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine
nothings alright nothing is fine
im running and im cryin

im cryin im cryin
im cryin im cryin

i cant go on living this way

cut my life into pieces
this is my last resort suffocation no breathing
would it be wrong would it be right
mutilation out of sight
and im contemplating suicide

cause im losing my sight losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine
losing my sight losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine
nothings alright nothing is fine
im running and im cryin

i cant go on living this way

cant go on living this way
nothings alright


broken home
all alone
broken home
all alone

i cant seem to fight these feelings
im caught in the middle of this
and my wounds are not healing
im stuck in between my parents
i wish i had someone to talk to
someone i could confide in
i just want to know the truth
i just want to know the truth
want to know the truth

broken home
all alone

i know my mother loves me
but does my father even care
if im sad or angry
you were never ever there
when i needed you
i hope you regret what you did
i think i know the truth
your father did the same to you
did the same to you

what is wrong with me
i cannot fight now
i feel like a weak link

what is wrong with me
i cannot fight now
i feel like a weak link
a weak link

broken home
all alone

it feels bad to be alone
crying by yourself living in a broken home
how could i tell it so all you could feel it
depression strikes hard just like my old earth would tell it

to me her son she told me im the one
pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
stories that i tell are nonfiction
and you cant take it back cause its already done

broken home
broken home

cant seem to fight these feelings
caught in the middle of this
my wounds are not healing
stuck in between my parents

broken home

theres no money theres no possessions
take my money take my obsession

i just wanna be heard loud and clear are my words
comin from within man tell em what you heard
its about a revolution in your heart and in your mind
you cant find the conclusion

lifestyle and obsession
diamond rings get you nothin but a lifelong lesson
and youre pocket book stressin
youre a slave to the system workin jobs that you hate
its too bad the world is based on greed

step back and see
stop thinkin bout yourself start thinkin bout

theres no money theres no possession
take my money take my possession
take my obsession i dont need that

cause everything is nothing and emptiness is in everything
with the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
flip it inside out its a big black hole
take your money burn it up like an asteroid
possessions they are never gonna fill the void
take it away and learn the best lesson
the heart the soul the life the passion

theres no money theres no possession
take my money take my possession

money possession obsession

present yourself press your clothes
comb your hair and clock in
you just cant win just cant win
and the things you own own you now

take my money take my possession

money possession obsession


watch your back because the next man is comin
and you dont know if the next man is dumbin
survival of the fittest what it is

sickenin thought is running through my head
thats when i realize im glad im not dead

corruption and abuse
the salesman of our blood
for the publics craving
existence in the dark

its in our nature to destroy ourselves
its in our nature to kill ourselves
its in our nature to kill each other
its in our nature to kill kill kill

it was a dream and then it hit me reality struck
and now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
close to buck  and we all stand strong
in respect to the family in times of our insanity
and through words of profanity
i describe our dysfunctional family
blood brothers keep it real to the end
deeper than thoughts that you think not a trend

corruption and abuse
the salesman of our blood
for the publics craving
existence in the dark

its in our nature to destroy ourselves
its in our nature to kill ourselves
its in our nature to kill each other
its in our nature to kill kill kill

its in our nature to kill ourselves
its in our nature to kill each other
its in our nature to kill kill kill
again and again

gently my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure
a pleasure that will take my mind off the realities of my life
my past life
life as i know it now

and whatever may come it slowly disappears
to somewhere in the back of my mind
and it will remain there till i wish to retrieve it

yes i will stay here for awhile for i need the break
a break from the pressures of life
and everything that lay in the palm of lifes hands
lifes hands

this mode is incredible its out of this world
too bad i must always leave it

uninformed is one thing stupid is another
keep running your mouth but dont call me brother

im trying to find someone on my side cause banging heads all the time starts to grind at my gears and at my will
but persistent i am still

blow to the head then an entrail rend
guts on the floor do you want more

for our past mistakes extinction we are hurled
trying to make amends for the impergium

you dont want to know
all of the power of the wyld that runs through me yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
you dont want to see
our viewpoint on what hobbits are doing the black inside when frenzy is brewing
you dont want to feel
the sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going
i wont let you be

im trying to set my mind free im sorry you never knew me
my soul is in recession painful to make this confession

cycle of life and death supposedly
goes round and round yet it stops with me

glorious hunter of my faith i have sinned
killers are quiet like the breath of the wind

filling the shadows with forms of my own
raised by kindred of get i was born

abomination world in disarray
killers are quiet when they seek the vitae

reflection beckons a portal shard
spiritual quest i must stay on guard

stepping sideways betweens worlds i shift
killers are quiet when they are born with the gift

beautiful anguish cast out by my race
now one thats ageless i save my own face

i write my own laws with death i break bread
killers are quiet when they come from my head

running out of ways to run
i cant see i cant be
over and over and under my skin
all this attention is doing me in

dont belong dont exist

picking through the parts exposed
taking shape taking shag
over and over and under my skin
all this momentum is doing me in

dont belong dont exist

burn

you got all my love living in your own hate
dripping hole man hard step no fate
show you nothing but i aint holding back
every damn word i say is a sneak attack
when i get my hands on you
get this cause youre never gonna get me
i am the very disease you pretend to be

i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move

dont belong dont exist

did you never give a damn in the first place
maybe its time you had the tables turned
cause in the interest of all involved
i got the problem solved and the verdict is guilty

man nearly killed me stepping where you fear to tread
stop drop and roll you were dead from the getgo
are you scared of me now then youre dumber than i thought

always is and never was
foundation made of piss and vinegar
just another dumb punk chomping at this tit
is there any way to break through the noise
was it something that i said that got you bent
gotta be that way if you want it
sanity literal profanity hit me

spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out

maybe its the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder
keeping all your little spies and leaving when you realize
step up fairy i guess its time to bury your ass with a chrome straight to the dome
and if you know whats good just shut up and beg brother
backstab dont you know who youre dissing
sideswipe we know the ass that youre kissing

come up and you get a face full o tactic
lipping off hard going home in a basket
you got no pull no power no nothing
payoffs dont protect and you can hide if you want
but ill find you coming up behind you

spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out

back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
cant escape this place i deny your face

someone hear me please all i see is hate
i can hardly breathe and i can hardly take it

hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
hands on my face overbearing i cant

lost ran at my own cost fearing laughter scoffed
learning from the rush detached from such and such
bleak all around me weak listening incomplete
i am not a dog but im the one youre dogging

i am in a buried kennel i have never felt so final
someone find me please losing all reserve

hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
hands on my face overbearing i cant

breathe ambercult breathe one more seethe freak like you got a pair
wont be my fault when youre painted in the corner of a nogood life this is


i cant remember i dont understand is it malice that makes you this way
carry it with you till someone forgives you i laugh cause theres nothing to say
you cant begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when youre here
none of us wonder what weather youre under youre making it perfectly clear

can you look in my eyes when my backs against the wall
slash at my eyes surprise youll never get me
youre all reality and sound bites and the freedom is never in plain sight

its no kind of life this is no kind of life you cant blame me
i cant be i cant be i cant be blamed


im cold im ugly
im always confused by everything
i can stare into a thousand eyes
but every smile hides a boldfaced lie

it itches it seethes it festers and breathes
my heroes are dead they died in my head
thin out the herd and squeeze out the pain
something inside me has opened up again

thoughts of me exemplified
all the real flaws i have denied
forget today forget whatever happened
every day i see a little more overall deficiencies
im nothing short of being one complete catastrophe

what the hell did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this

i save all the bullets from ignorant minds
your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
way past good taste on our way to bad omens
i decrease while my symptoms increase

you act like you knew it all along
your timing sucks your silence is a blessing
all i ever wanted out of you was something you could never be

what the hell did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this

i havent got time for the living i havent got time for the living

give me any reason why id need you

i see you in me i see you in me
i see you in me i see you in me
i see you in me i see you in me
i see you in me i see you in me

i keep my scars from prying eyes
incapable of ever knowing why
somebody breathe ive got to have an answer
why am i so fascinated by bigger pictures better things
but i dont care what you think youll never understand me

what the hell did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this

im not the second coming im the first wave
better get an army cause the fire left me unscathed
so stick around cause ill get to you in just a few
step off the achtung get back or get stung
idiotic sense of yourself are you that dumb
entire legion of me totalitarian

cause i cant stand it planned gonna crashland it
in other words consider me branded
another version of me another version of you
both barrels what you gonna do

all i hear is human noise
i belong to only me
silence for my revelry

i can only die over time
filthy hands stay away from mine
every reason is a right to hate
painful clutch death is fine give me mine

only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away

somebody explain this
you dont care cause you dont exist
reckoning

only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away

only one of us walks away walks away
only one of us walks away walks away
only one of us walks away walks away
only one of us walks away walks away


i play doctor for five minutes flat
before i cut my heart open and let the air out
three bugs a pound of dust
some wind spilled before me
in the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout

as i lie there with my tongue spread wide open
a black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
as i injected the candy heart that i selected
she said dont hesitate just do what you have to do to me

its hard to stay between the lines of skin
just cause i have nerves dont mean that i can feel
i wasnt very much fun to be with anyway
just let the blood run red cause i cant feel

its hard to stay between the lines of skin
just cause i have nerves dont mean that i can feel
i wasnt very much fun to be with anyway
just let the blood run red cause i cant feel

since im putting down
all of the true things around but i like it
handed down the crown
given the jewels and the answers of may
thought of being ousted
comes and goes comes and goes
when i think about it
the wind blows

hate it hate it hate it hate it
hate it hate it hate it

run me out of town
somewhere a move might intended a gown at
pissed at all the bowels
always the blues and a delicate smile
missed all of the sideways
gull and noun gull and noun
chills and petty bandaids
wrapped around

hate it hate it hate it hate it
hate it hate it hate it

good grief

the train that i got onto up and left that town
threw it up as it went down
strange enough it left me rude and turned around
watched as they all took their vows

fools were drawing trying to save that day
i dont doubt that anyway

phase it out until the older ones return
have a seat and watch it burn
trace around the corner this is what ive learned
always waited for my turn

fools were drawing trying to save that day
i dont doubt that anyway

after the bliss has long ended
this caution this fault

accosted adult arrested

you may know by that
ive got a friend somewhere


the other day they waited
the sky was dark and faded
solemnly they stated
he has to die
you know he has to die

and all the children learning
from books that they were burning
every leaf was turning
to watch him die
you know he has to die

the summer sun looked down on him
his mother could but frown on him
and all the other sound on him
but it doesnt seem to matter

and when the day had ended
with rainbow colors blended
his mind remained unbended
he had to die
you know he had to die

spanish lady come to me
she lays on me this rose
it rainbow spirals round and round
it trembles and explodes

it left a smoking crater of my mind
i like to blow away
but the heat came round and busted me
for smiling on a cloudy day


escaping through the lily fields
i came across an empty space
it trembled and exploded
left a bus stop in its place

the bus came by and i got on
thats when it all began
there was cowboy neal at the wheel
of a bus to neverever land


and when the day had ended
with rainbow colors blended
his mind remained unbended
he had to die
you know he had to die

he had to die
you know he had to die

he had to die
well you know he had to die


last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born
black madonna two eagles hang against a cloud
sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone
all graceful instruments are known

when the windows all are broken and your loves become a toothless crone
when the voices of the storm sound like a crowd
winter morning breaks youre all alone

the eyes are blind blue visions all a seer can own
and touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
this ground on which the seed of love is sown
all graceful instruments are known


it seems i have been here before
and i dont want to see anybody cry

you dont have to tell me why

it aint cause im the only one left darling
bout the time the sun rises west
feeling groovy looking fine

think ill come back here again
every now and then from time to time

my how lovely you are my dear
the ball game has gone much too far my dear
sing to me do your thing to me

meet me some morning now meet me some morning


sleepy alligator in the noonday sun
call for his whiskey he can call for his tea

oh no well ive been there before
and not coming back around there no more

hung up waiting for a windy day
hung up waiting for a windy day

creepy alligator coming all around the bend
talking bout the times when we was mutual friends
ill check my memory and i check it again yes i will

oh no well ive been there before
and i aint coming back around there no more no im not

riding down the river in an old canoe
a bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
out of the river all ugly and green
the biggest old alligator that ive ever seen

teeth big and pointy and his eyes were bugging out
contracted the union put the beggars to rout
screaming and yelling he was picking his chops
he never runs he just stumbles and hops
just out of prison on six dollars bail

alligator running round my door
alligator running round my door
alligator running round my door
alligator running round my door

alligators creeping in and hes crawling around on my cabin floor
hes coming round to bother me some more

alligator

saint stephen with a rose
in and out of the garden he goes
country garland in the wind and the rain
wherever he goes the people all complain

stephen prospered in his time
well he may and he may decline
did it matter does it now
stephen would answer if he only knew how

wishing well with a golden bell
bucket hanging clear to hell
hell halfway twixt now and then
stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

lady finger dipped in moonlight
writing what for across the morning sky
sunlight splatters dawn with answer
darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

speeding arrow sharp and narrow
what a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned

several seasons with their treasons
wrap the babe in scarlet covers call it your own

did he doubt or did he try
answers aplenty in the bye and bye
talk about your plenty talk about your ills
one man gathers what another man spills

saint stephen will remain
all he lost he shall regain
seashore washed by the suds and the foam
been there so long hes got to calling it home

fortune comes acrawling calliope woman
spinning that curious sense of your own
can you answer yes i can
but what would be the answer to the answer man

boots were of leather
a breath of cologne
her mirror was a window
she sat quite alone

all around her
the garden grew
scarlet and purple
and crimson and blue

she came and she went
and at last went away
the garden was sealed
when the flowers decayed

on the wall of the garden
no one may come here
since no one may stay


da da da da da da da da da da da

sitting in mangrove valley chasing light beams
everything wanders from baby to z

everywhere i go the people all know
everyones doing that rag
everywhere i go the people all know
everyones doing that rag

take my line go fishing for a tuesday
maybe take my supper eat it down by the sea
gave my baby twenty forty good reasons
couldnt find any better ones in the morning at three

rain gonna come but the rain gonna go
stepping off sharply from the rank and file
awful cold and dark like a dungeon
maybe get a little bit darker fore the day

hipsters tripsters real cool chicks sir
cause everyones doing that rag
hipsters tripsters real cool chicks sir
cause everyones doing that rag

you neednt gild the lily offer jewels to the sunset
no one is watching or standing in your shoes
wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning
everything promised is delivered to you

dont neglect to pick up what your share is
all the winter birds are winging home now
hey love go and take a look around you
nothing out there you havent seen before now

but you can wade in the water and never get wet
if you keep on doing that rag
wade in the water and never get wet
if you keep on doing that rag

one eyed jacks and the deuces are wild
and the aces are crawling up and down your sleeve
come back here baby louise
and tell me the name of the game that you play

is it all fall down

hey tom banjo
hey a laurel
more than laurel you may sow
more than laurel you may sow

hey the laurel
hey the city in the rain
hey hey hey the white wheat
waving in the wind

 degrees of solitude  degrees in all
all the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall
lost is a long and loneliest time fairy sybil flying
all along the all along the mountains of the moon

hey tom banjo
its time to matter
the earth will see you on through this time
the earth will see you on through this time

down by the water the marsh kings daughter

look for awhile
at the china cat sunflower
proudwalking jingle

copperdome bodhi
drip a silver kimono
like a crazyquilt stargown

krazy kat peeking
through a lace bandana
like a oneeyed cheshire
like a diamondeye jack

a leaf of all colors plays
a golden string fiddle
to a doublee waterfall
over my back

comic book colors
on a violin river
crying leonardo words
from out a silk trombone

i rang a silent bell
beneath a shower of pearls
in the eagle wing palace
of the queen chinee


waves of violet go crashing and laughing
the rainbow winged singing birds fly round the sun
sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn

whats become of the baby this cold december morning

songbirds frozen in their flight
drifting to the earth remnants of forgotten dreaming
calling answer comes there none
go to sleep you child dream of neverending always

panes of crystal eyes sparkle like waterfalls
lighting the polished ice caverns of khan
but where in the lookingglass fields of illusion
wandered the child who was perfect as dawn

whats become of the baby this cold december morning
whats become of the baby this cold december morning

racing rhythms of the sun
all the world revolves captured in the eye of odin
allah pray where are you now
all mohammeds men are blinded by the sparkling waters
scheherazade gathering stories to tell
from primal gold fantasy petals that fall

but where is the child who played with the sun chimes
and chased the cloud sheep to the regions of rhyme
stranded stream cries the south wind
lost in the regions of lead
shadowlike chains of illusion delusions of living and dead


cosmic charlie how do you do
truckin in style along the avenue
dumdee dumdee doodleydoo
go on home your mamas calling you

kalico kahlia come tell me the news
calamitys waiting for a way to get to her
rosy red and electric blue
i bought you a paddle for your paper canoe

say youll come back when you can
whenever your airplane happens to land
maybe ill be back here too
it all depends on whats with you

hung up waiting for a windy day
kite one ice since the first of february
mama keeps saying that the wind might blow
but standing here i say i just dont know

new ones coming as the old ones go
everythings moving here but much too slow now
a little bit quicker and we might have time
to say how do you do before were left behind

calliope wail like a seaside zoo
the very last lately inquired about you
its really very one or two
the first you wanted the last i knew

i just wonder if you shouldnt feel
less concerned about the deep unreal
the very first word is how do you do
the last go home your mamas calling you

calling you
calling you
calling you
calling you

calling you
go on home your mamas calling you
calling you
go on home your mamas calling you
calling you
go on home your mamas calling you

go on home your mamas calling you


dark star crashes
pouring its light into ashes

reason tatters
the forces tear loose from the axis

searchlight casting
for faults in the clouds of delusion

shall we go you and i while we can

mirror shatters
in formless reflections of matter

glass hand dissolving
to ice petal flowers revolving

lady in velvet

shall we go you and i while we can

high green chilly winds and windy vines
in loops around the twisted shafts of lavender
theyre crawling to the sun

underfoot the ground is patched
with arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita
stark and shiny in the breeze

wonder who will water all the children of the garden
when they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
droop so hungry neath the sky

william tell has stretched his bow till it wont stretch
no furthermore andor it may require a change that hasnt come before

no more time to tell how this is the season of what
now is the time of returning with our thought
jewels polished and gleaming
now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein

seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll
six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow
five men writing with fingers of gold
four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
riding in the whalebelly fade away in moonlight
sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below

cowgirl king of the rodeo

and your toes creepin around
ah so mundane and incomplete
hand me down my pants and get me off this street

im passed out in your garden
im in i cant get off
so soft
id pop myself in your body
id come into your party
but im soft

behind the fringe of a whiskey high
mutilating cat like eyes
and in your nose blood decadence
you try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
you paint my fingers and you paint my toes
you let your perfect nipple show

im passed out in your garden
im in i cant get off
so soft
id pop myself in your body
id come into your party
but im soft
but im soft

im passed out in your garden
im in i cant get off im so soft
id pop myself in your body
id come all over your party but im soft

wash my bugle boy a watching my throne
sweet mutilations of a sold to nothing man
lord have mercy shake is falling through your hand

razz the kid

razz the kid

toss me a breath when you hold me down
hot like a razor on my face
somethings growing that dont help me now
paging the doctor just in case

low and behold things are killing me
silly expectation of a dream
girls are gonna love the way i toss my hair
boys are gonna hate the way i seem

a roar turned into whispers
everyone stood there

as the sound split the ngiht
they ran hiding from the light

well i didnt see no shotgun

but i saw this crazy black guy
with the demon in his eye
and i heard him say white man
ive seen that silver cue
you dont remember me well
but i remember you

they ran hiding from the light

well the knife just left his fingers
as the black guy took his aim
white guys head exploded
the black gut howled in pain
then everybody scattered
i heard some woman scream
god damn you old black bastard
youve blown away my dreams

they ran hiding from the light

in the land where horses born with eagle wings
and honey bees have lost their stings
theres singing forever
lions den with fallow deer
and rivers made from wine so clear
flow on and on forever
dragons fly like sparrows through the air
and baby lambs where samson dares
to go on on on on on on

my fairy king can see things
he rules the air and turns the tides
that are not there for you and me
ooh yeah he guides the winds

my fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
to run like thieves and to kill like knives
to take away the power from the magic hand
to bring about the ruin to the promised land

they turn the milk into sour
like the blue in the blood of my veins
why cant you see it
fire burnin in hell with the cry of screaming pain
son of heaven set me free and let me go
sea turn dry no salt from sand
seasons fly no helping hand
teeth dont shine like pearls for the poor mans eyes

someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
broken my fairy circle ring
and shamed the king in all his pride
changed the winds and wronged the tides

so sad her eyes
smiling dark eyes
so sad her eyes
as it began

upon my brow the lightest kiss
i walked alone
and all around the air did say
my lady soon will stir this way
in sorrow known

the white queen walks
stars of lovingness in her hair

heeding unheard
pleading one word
so sad her eyes
she cannot see

how did thee fare what have thee seen
the mother of the willow green
i call her name
and neath her window have i stayed
i loved the footsteps that she made
and when she came

white queen how my heart did ache
and dry my lips no words could make
so still i wait

my goddess hear my darkest fear
i speak too late
its forevermore that i wait
dear friend goodbye
no tears in my eyes
so sad it ends as it began


you never heard my song before
the music was too loud
but now i think you hear me well
for now we both know how
no star can light our way
in this cloud of dark and fear
but some day one day

funny how the pages turn
and hold us in between
a misty castle waits for you
and you shall be a queen
today the cloud it hangs
over us and all is grey
but some day one day

when i was you and you were me
and we were very young
together took us nearly there
the rest may not be sung
so still the cloud it hangs
over us and were alone
but some day one day

well come home

and you can say that my hairs a disgrace
or just find me an open car
ill make the speed of light outta this place

stairway scared dan dare whos there

lime and limpid green

there was a king who ruled the land
his majesty was in command
with silver eyes the scarlet eagle
showered silver on the people
oh mother tell me more

whydyou have to leave me there
hanging in my infant air waiting
you only have to read the lines of
scribbly black and everything shines

across the stream with wooden shoes
bells to tell the king the news
a thousand misty riders
climb up higher once upon a time

wondering and dreaming
the words had different meaning
yes they did

for all the time spent in that room
the dolls house darkness old perfume
and fairy stories held me high
on clouds of sunlight floating by
oh mother tell me more
tell me more


alone in the clouds all blue
lying on an eiderdown yippee
you cant see me but i can you

lazing in the foggy dew
sitting on a unicorn no fear
you cant hear me but i can you

watching buttercups cup the light
sleeping on a dandelion too much
i wont touch you but then i might

screaming through the starlit skies
traveling by telephone
hey ho here we go
ever so high

alone in the clouds all blue
lying on an eiderdown yippee
you cant see me but i can you

a gnome named grimble gromble
and little gnomes stay in their homes

a bluegreen hood it looked quite good

amidst the grass fresh air at last
wining dining biding his time

look at the sky look at the river

winding finding places to go

and then one day

he stood in a field where barley grows

his head did no thinking his arms didnt move
except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground
he stood in a field where barley grows

the black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
but now hes resigned to his fate cause lifes not unkind he doesnt mind
he stood in a field where barley grows

trying to impress but feeling rather empty
i had another drink
drink  a  drink  a  drink  a  drink

what a way to spend that evening
they all turn up with their friends
playing the game
theyre in the scene always should have been
far away
away  away  away  away  away
getting up i feel as if im remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget

pretend the phone rings and someone speaks
she would very much like to go out to a show
so what can i do  i cant think of what to say
she sees through anyway
away  away  away  away  away

out of the front door i go
traffics moving rather slow
arriving late there she waits
looking very angry as cross as she can be
be  a  be  a  be  a  be  a  be
getting up i feel as if im remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget

the chief defect of henry king
was chewing little bits of string
at last he swallowed some which tied
itself in ugly knots inside

wondering and dreaming
the words have different meanings
yes they did

finding she was left alone
went tiptoe to the telephone 
summoned the immediate aid
of londons noble fire brigade

for all the time spent in that room
the dolls house darkness old perfume
and fairy stories held me high
on clouds of sunlight floating by
oh mother tell me more
tell me more


it would be so nice
it would be so nice
it would be so nice
to meet sometime

everybody wakes and in the morning
hot tea and cant stop yawning

reading all about the plane thats landed
upside down

there can be no other way
but i would just like to say

it would be so nice

to meet sometime

everybody lives beneath the ceiling
living out a dream that sends them reeling
to a distant place

there can be no other way
but i would just like to say

biggest brown eyes i ever seen
oh baby
hey baby wanna take a ride on the bus
with your mom

out of love
out of love
out of love
out of love






one heart one other
they met last summer
one move she started
now they love this way
the pain of pleasure
lying together
youre at their mercy
as the telephones ringing on

risk your life for a stolen kiss

we live we learn we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love
we live we learn we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love

each move goes so slow
until the doors close
no secret codes now
no words as baby goes down
one last dance then goodbye
practicing his love lies
he runs to his wife
and youre left holding the knife

you live your life to take that chance
when youre a master of the art of romance
and you know you wont cross that line
until that last slow dance

we live we learn we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love
we live we learn we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love

alone our lonely hearts would die
its all in the game
and the way that its played
theres no time to wonder why
to catch you when you fall
answer when you call
no one can hear you cry

we live we learn we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love
we live we learn we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love


you need someone to hold you tight
sometimes love dont know wrong from right
another long and senseless
fight was all you knew theyre all the same
theres no one left to take the blame
whats behind this masquerade
how do we win these losin
games we play words we say
cutting wounds we know they run so deep
leave it all behind you
or someday love will find you

only lonely  i cant stop hurting you
only lonely  but i cant stop loving you
only lonely  how much pain does it take

its getting sometimes i dont know
when to stop when to go
sometimes were so afraid to let it show
a stolen kiss so out of place
it wipes the smile right off your face
and when those feelings start
we let them go let them go

games we play words we say
cutting wounds that run so deep
leave it all behind you
or someday love will find you

only lonely  i cant stop hurting you
only lonely  but i cant stop loving you
only lonely  so tell me babe how much pain
can you take before your heart breaks

i got this timebomb ticking in my head
this time i think shes gonna blow
how can i say get away
when i just cant let go

games we play words we say
cutting wounds that run so
leave it all behind you
or someday love will find you

only lonely  i cant stop hurting you
only lonely  but i cant stop loving you
only lonely  how much pain does it take


listen people cant you hear the voices that are crying out
theres a hunger burning in the heart of their souls
maybe now that i got you let me tell you what im talking bout

i been down and mistreated
now were standing undefeated

im the king of the mountain
im the king of the hill
im the king of the mountain
im the king of the hill

you spend your life working  to  its like doing time
boss man says hey boy youll never be no good

i been down and mistreated
now were standing undefeated

im the king of the mountain
im the king of the hill
im the king of the mountain
im the king of the hill

listen people cant you hear the voices that are crying out
theres a hunger burning in the heart of their souls
maybe now that i got you let me tell you what im talking bout

i been down and mistreated
we wont be cheated
now were standing undefeated

im the king of the mountain
im the king of the hill
im the king of the mountain
im the king of the hill


after the smoke clears
when its down to you and i
when the sun appears
and theres nothing left but goodbyes
well just turn and walk away
how could we let it end like this
just turn and walk away
should we seal it with a kiss

its too late
now youre out and on the run
its too late
held up in love without a gun

we hold up our candle light
no words to say
and were both too tired to fight
just hold me close and dont let go

it was all so simple when
you were to be queen and id be your king
i guess those dreams got lost
cause baby youre still you and im still me
now letting go
its always the hardest part to fight
when we both know

its too late
too late to wonder why
much too late
to save a love thats died

we hold up our candle light
no words to say
and were both too tired to fight
just hold me close and dont let go

just hold me close and dont let me go

after the smoke cleared
it was down to you and i
when the sun appeared
there was nothing left but goodbyes


in the heat of the street of the city
a young boy hides the pain
and he walks so tall trying to hang on
but he knows hes going down again
i know hes going down

darkness fades hes the prince of his city
in a place where they all know your name
you can see in their eyes life so paralyzed
youre just a pawn in a losin game
you lose at life it aint no game

hear their cries
stay alive

all alone in a place where the lonely
they all have to walk through the rain
and they dance on the edge where you only
only pray that it has to end

hear their cries
stay alive

these four walls they could tell you some stories
about lying and dying and fame
theres a price that you pay for the glory
about losing and choosing and pain

hear their cries
stay alive


the clock strikes ten
out on the streets again
i been looking for something to please me since i dont know when
out on the dark side of town
another rumbles gone down
and life on the high side isnt what this boys about

shes got something i want man its something i need

i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby i can always run

to a heart of chrome
and a soul of steel
weve done more white lines than youll know any one we could steal
and when i give her the gun
you know she feels so right
and we dont let go when were alone when im holding her so tight

shes got something i want man its something i need

i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby i can always run

and when the morning comes and i go to sleep
when i close my eyes shes waiting for me

i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby i can always run


we would take no prisoners
cause there was nobody giving in
they came walking through my jungle
and met an angel about to sin
i heard a voice from inside of me
can you help me hear me call

to the fire
to the fire

when youre a part of society
you know the heart of your innocence dies
when we met with authority
i looked him right between the eyes
cause all we had was our innocence
all we had was our hearts to try to win the fight you tell me
can you save me from it all

to the fire
to the fire

to the fire
to the fire

can you help me hear me call
can you save me from it all

to the fire
to the fire


riding high then shot down
i load my guns to fire another round
i look deep into your eyes
and cant run theres nowhere left to hide
dont stop no its much too late
oh i live love to lose control
it makes me crazy i want to let you know

oh no i dont want to fall
oh oh cant you hear me calling
you tell me im the one
when im next to you  next to you
all i want in my secret dreams
is you here with me
i got to get to you get to you get to you

theres a thrill in the chase
we wont lose when we meet face to lace
love games a means without and end
i go down but ill be back again
when youre with me in my sleep

oh no i dont want to fall
oh oh cant you hear me calling
you tell me im the one
when im next to you  next to you

what we break up of their rules

well i saw captain kidd on sunset

where everybody goes
to get on their rockin horse

you cant stop a fire burning out of control
let it rock let it go
you got to let it rock

dr bon jovi report to emergency

you can read it in the papers
in some places it comes in thirtytwo flavors
but you wouldnt tell no one
your favorite if you could

from the white house to the alleys
from the president down to long tall sally
cant live with it but
youll die without it  yes you would

senoritas in the kitchen
shes a fistful of dynamite

you cant start a fire without a spark
but theres something that i guarantee
you cant hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease

where you look you can find it
try to run but youre always behind it
so you play hide and seek like a blind kid
till youre caught  yeah youre caught

so youll say that you had some
but they took it and held it for ransom
were they tall dark skinny or
handsome  you wont talk

so you telephone your doctor
just to see what pill to take
you know theres no prescription
gonna wipe this one away

you cant start a fire without a spark
but theres something that i guarantee
you cant hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
love is a social disease
love is a social disease

shes so full of high grade octane
she could run the bullet train on  double ds
now you know for sure you know the cure
to make a blind man see

you cant start a fire without a spark
but theres something that i guarantee
you cant hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
love is a social disease

you cant start a fire without a spark
but theres something that i guarantee
you cant hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
love is a social disease baby
love is a social disease

nothing a shot cant cure


its all the same only the names will change
every day it seems were wasting away
another place where the faces are so cold

im a cowboy on a steel horse i ride
im wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive

sometimes i sleep sometimes its not for days
the people i meet always go their separate ways
sometimes you tell the day
by the bottle that you drink
and times when youre alone all you do is think

im a cowboy on a steel horse i ride

oh and i ride

yeah

im a cowboy on a steel horse i ride

and i walk these streets a loaded six string on my back
i play for keeps cause i might not make it back

she wasnt young but still a child
there still was innocence
in painted smiles
she called to me as i passed her by
but one thing always stays the same

without love theres nothing without love
nothing else feels right without love

i saw a man down on lonely street
a broken man who looked like me
and no one knows the pain that hes been living
he lost his love and still hasnt forgiven
but one thing always stays the same

without love theres nothing without love
nothing else feels right without love

theres nothing without love
nothing else but love can burn as bright
and nothing would mean nothing without love

i see my life
some things i took for granted
loves passed me by
so many second chances
i was afraid
i wont be afraid no more

without love theres nothing without love
nothing else feels right without love

theres nothing without love
nothing else but love can burn as bright
and nothing would mean nothing without love

theres nothing without love
nothing without love


if you could see inside my heart
then you would understand
id never mean to hurt you
baby im not that kind of man

i might not say im sorry
yeah i might talk tough sometimes
and i might forget the little things
or keep you hanging on the line

in a world that dont know romeo and juliet
boy meets girl and promises we cant forget
we are cast from edens gate with no regrets
into the fire we cry

id die for you
id cry for you
id do anything
id lie for you
you know its true
baby id die for you
id die for you
id cry for you
if it came right down to me and you
you know its true baby id die for you

i might not be a savior
and ill never be a king
i might not send you roses
or buy you diamond rings

but if i could see inside you
maybe id know just who we are
cause our love is like a hunger
without it we would starve

in a world that dont know romeo and juliet
boy meets girl and promises we cant forget
we are cast from edens gate with no regrets
into the fire we cry

id die for you
id cry for you
id do anything
id lie for you
you know its true
baby id die for you

id cry for you
if it came right down to me and you
you know its true baby id die for you

and i held you in my arms so strong

we danced so close
we danced so slow
and i swore id never let you go
together  forever

just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

my uncle bill my belisha beacon
the headshrinkers they want everything
my uncle bill my belisha beacon

and if youre frightened you can be frightened
you can be its okay
and if youre frightened you can be frightened

starve the poor so they can be wellfed
line their holes with the dead ones bread

but no ones ever taken me
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away

i swear i recognize your breath
memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
me you wouldnt recall for im not my former
its hard when youre stuck upon the shelf

i changed by not changing at all
small town predicts my fate
perhaps thats what no one wants to see

i just want to scream hello
my god its been so long
never dreamed youd return
but now here you are and here i am
hearts and thoughts they fade away

hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away

hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade


troubled souls unite

i am fuel you are friends
we got the means to make amends
i am lost im no guide
but im by your side
i am right by your side yeah

young lover i stand
it was their idea i proved to be a man
it was their idea i proved to be a man

will myself to find a home
a home within myself
we will find a way
we will find our place

drop the leash drop the leash
drop the leash drop the leash

drop the leash we are young
drop the leash we are young
drop the leash drop the leash
get outta my my

delight delight delight in our youth


i will light a match this morning so i wont be alone
watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone
oh i will stand arms outstretched pretend im free to roam
oh i will make my way through one more day in hell

how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make

i will hold the candle until it burns up my arm
oh ill keep taking punches until their will grows tired
oh i will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
hey i wont change direction and i wont change my mind

how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make

ill swallow poison until i grow immune
i will scream my lungs out till it fills this room

how much difference
how much difference
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make


lives opened and trashed
look ma watch me crash
no time to question
whyd nothing last

grasp and hold on
were dying fast
soon be over
and i will relent

let the ocean swell
dissolve way my past
three days and maybe longer
wont even know ive left

under your tongue
im like a tab
i will give you
what youre not sposed to have

under my breath
i swear by sin
for better or worse
a best we began

let the sun climb
oh burn way my mask
three days and maybe longer
shed my skin at last shed shed

let the sun shine
burn way my mask
three days and maybe longer
wont ever find me here

let the ocean
dissolve way my past
four days and not much longer
let my spirit pass

this is this is
this is this is
this is this is
this is this is my last exit
