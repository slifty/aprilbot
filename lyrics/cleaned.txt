one, two, three
uh and here we go

sending this message into space with my ray gun
hoping that important ears will hear this when the days done
so far it's been great fun
you would swear i've been playing with myself
'cause i been doing me since day one
they used to swear that i would never have a smash hit
now i see them haters double-take no ad-libs
'cause what comes from his lips is crack, chapstick
what i'm composing, i'm singing, mixing, and writing bars
so i guess i make it easy to pick out my flaws
'cause when one things crazy another's sub-par
so i guess i gotta make it work tr-tr-triple times as hard
the engineers will have my head is the mix is off
rappers will be coming at my neck if the 16 is wrong
singers keep telling me that i got a couple vocals flaws
but every single one of them is like "yo! your talents raw"

i think i'm heading in the right direction
i think i'm heading in the right direction
i think i'm heading in the right direction
i think i'm heading in the right direction
oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh

a... yeah first time listening to me
if you just popped a mixtape in or something
this is what i do, i make feel good music
i guess don't expect anything more or less
i just make whatever i feel like making

so please don't try and save me
this is how my story ends
this keeps me from going crazy
so i'll be writing till my death
i'm on my 3am flow and i'm chilling with these lights low

i think i'm heading in the right direction
i think i'm heading in the right direction
i think i'm heading in the right direction
i think i'm heading in the right direction
oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh

but yeah, like i said
the label is beautiful mind
my name is jon bellion and the mixtape is scattered thoughts volume 1
welcome, hope you like it. word!
yo, this beat is tough
i mean i made it but this beat is tough
i can say that


so basically you're like the only person
who's not impressed by any of this and i love that

work-a-holic, i'm a bad one
sitting in front of this computer
couldn't move me with a handgun
us musicians are a sad bunch
half the time i can't remember if i had lunch

she knows, knows my, knows my

i understood when you were mad at me
when i was late to the cheesecake factory
i came an hour late but you fled the scene

before anybody's trunk knocked
i was a skinny little italian
with nothing but a jump shot
and if i ever got a hot head
she would call up judy bellion
in a hot sec, you bet

she's like a song so eclectic
and her eyes are like a string section
and her legs are like a electric guitar
and i'm hendrix
i'm tempted to shred along her frets kid

you get it?
like shred along her frets
like a guitar reference 'cause her legs...
like i'm basically explaining this right now
she's not even gonna be able to follow what's going on
and i think, like i said before
that's what i like most about her
what's wrong with me?

she sees past everything
no smoke, no mirrors
to see me clearer
i think about wedding rings
and if she ever left this home
i'd have trouble breathing on my own
now i feel like you need to know
you gave wings, gave wings to my soul

thank you dilla for your swing and pocket
and ridiculous you did, that inspired me
and the roots, you guys go without say

but she knows my heart...
my heart...
my heart...


she's a lady when she shakes hands in the streets
but she's an animal once we're up in the sheets
and i never win in mario kart 'cause she always cheats
oh but that is okay because she's d.o.p.e
i have two parking tickets, she has forty-three
and all my friends they love her, she drinks more than me
and she really doesn't give a damn if i sing out of key
so baby what it look like, you're so d.o.p.e
uh and she's the definition of my everything
i want to tell her so many things
kick back, now i'm thinking about a wedding ring

she so dope, she so crazy
she's all mine so don't try to play me
'cause your hands have a hold on me

i-i-i was trying to stick so close to the plan
couldn't find my heart than it rose from the sand
so i propose a toast east coast to japan
give you a massage for your soul in my hands
so much in common
she is mos def the stars to my comet
she so new age and far from the logic
that i can't find love and have it for eternity
pick it up now
she could rock the hippy look she so outta sight
i'm just glad i made the cut, i'm so samurai
everything is cool with her, she don't need no candlelight
dinner, she's a winner, we can kick it, chill at t.g.i
fridays have a 2-for-1 but usually turns into 5
who the hell is driving home, guess we got a taxi ride
knock me out with a kiss like a jab
'cause it punch-drunk love in the back of the cab
and i can't feel my face
but you look so damn great

she so dope, she so crazy
she's all mine so don't try to play me
'cause your hands have a hold on me

d.o.p.e, d.o.p.e
and i can't feel my face
but you look so damn great
d.o.p.e, d.o.p.e
and i can't feel my face
but you look so damn great


baby let me know how it goes
when you go back to heaven for the day
and baby let me know how it goes
when you're loving him, but you should be loving me
and baby let me know how it goes
when you realize you and him were never meant to be
and baby let me know how it goes
when you realize, oh when you realize
you should've been loving me


mind, mind, yeah

ah...
get that soul back, i'm a get that soul back
t-t-trying to get that soul back
ah...
get that soul back, i'm a get that soul back
t-t-trying to get that soul back

i said "i'm just trying to get my soul back" yeah
said "i'm just trying to get my soul back"
some where along this road, may have lost my way
but baby i'm ready to step again
said "i'm just trying to get my soul back" yeah
said "i'm just trying to get my soul back"
i look right and i might just give you
something to talk about, baby you better tell a friend

i'm just trying to get my soul back
i'm just trying to get my soul back
see it don't matter what you say to me
you're making music for my soul
for my soul, for my soul

ah...
get that soul back, i'm a get that soul back
t-t-trying to get that soul back

my soul is a slick opportunist used in lyrics
here's a meal for your thoughts, food filled with spirit
never been affected by dudes who couldn't feel it
when i'm buried in the seam, i choose to kill bill it
i make music for my own uses
never worry about approval from so called cool kids
used to reduce thoughts of who i influenced
now i'm all about a target, hitting hearts like cupid
i from the land of break-beats and skate decks
baselines and backpacks, good tape and tape decks
making music from the heart
trying to separate the real from the fake
but was standing in the dark
they used to tell me where the honey's at
during their recording and i bought it
now i'm trying to get my money back
i can't say when me and soul departed
but i'm just trying to get back to where it started

ah...
get that soul back, i'm a get that soul back
t-t-trying to get that soul back


you know uh the world is a dangerous place baby and
and i think you just kick and stay in for the day
yeah, you can stay with me. i mean, you know
whatever happens, happens
you know it's dangerous out there, ya know?
let me talk to you

with so much wrong in the world
i'm just glad i found you
i'm just glad i found you
so many guns shot for no reason
i'm just glad i found you
i'm just glad i found you
oh

so lovely if we go outside
i think we'd be risking our lives

so i have an idea
we should make love, we should make love
till the world comes back around
till the world comes back around
we should make love, love, love, love, love
till the world comes back around

come on baby. you know, you know it sounds good
so let me, let me explain it to you

i'm just trying to lay low, she'll see where the day goes
stay home, i will give you loving by the case loads
stay up in the shade, you'll get burned by the sun's rays
don't go for a run cutie, i can make your pulse raise
risky situations for the birds, they can have 'em
'cause the only one i'm inviting, my friend sam adams
and eleven of his friends, make a twelve pack slap'em
on the couch, we can sip'em till it's safe outside
instead of watching the economy slide
i'm just trying to see my fingertips glide
across your body, that's the safest flight i'm gonna fly
lions, tigers, bears, oh my
'cause i'm a sure shot
leave it if the door knocks
'cause these sheets and these pillows and blankets be like fort knox
we can jam on the bed to we switch and let the floor rock

so lovely if we go outside
i think we'd be risking our lives

so lovely if we go outside
i think we'd be risking our lives

so i have an idea
we should make love, we should make love
till the world comes back around
till the world comes back around
we should make love, love, love, love, love
till the world comes back around

see i'll even do a piano solo for you
yeah! woo!
ewa-ewa-e, ass stay home, ewa, off day
so is that a yes or a no? hehehehe


dope little boy, uh
dope little boy
1, 2, 3

stay steady rockin'
feel good flow with a half-pipe jones
baby watch me drop in
i think the key is to never feel locked in
just as long as you comfy in the pocket
kids explore options
don't listen to the outside world, it's obnoxious
mentally and physically, you need to stay clocked in

dope little boy, boy
don't believe any of their lies
dope little boy, boy
dope little boy, boy
never ever will they break your flow
dope little boy, boy
just keep doing things from your soul

i ain't on the guest list, 'cause i ain't a big deal
mouth so fresh prince 'cause i gotta a stronger will
smith and wesson, keep bangin' on them, let 'em feel
everything you do and spread love till the grinned' real
why, look a live little boy? 'cause you're up next
now that i'm making it, these girls are sending dumb text
i won't change if ten-thousand and change
scream my name at a show like i had a lot of rough sex
please excuse the nerdiness, i'm flirting with a lot of styles
exploring lanes so insane, at a hundred miles
i'm just a kid, scruffy hair, with a goofy smile
but i had developed tough skin, no crocodiles
in the process of dream chasing
i will make what i feel like making
hip hop to pop is two languages
but i'm somewhere in the middle, so spanglish
and if you're not putting out a good vibe
stay the hell home 'cause we're trying to have good time
they say he's gotta climb, but he's been fine
'cause he feels good music in the air, wind chimes
just know that my patience wearing thin
'cause from cockiness to retardation is thin line
just know that i'm in it for the win
'cause i'm pushing real hard like i been ventured incline
dilla and the roots are stupid for this bassline
two thumbs up. woo! great time


okay so i wrote this song drunk
and i'm recording this song drunk
so this is for her

i'm staring at old picture frames
i think i kinda miss your face
maybe we could spend the day
remember how we used to lay down
and you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
and you know that this beer won't drink itself
hehehe, oh, oh

haven't seen you since last december
you're even prettier than i remember
oh, you're like a breath of fresh air i would take in
is it weird i wish you were naked
oh, you love my jokes
i said "oh, you always loved my jokes"
i said "oh"
so if i went to kiss you
would you kiss me back
said "oh,"
i know it's been a while but i hope so

i'm staring at old picture frames
i think i kinda miss your face
maybe we could spend the day
remember how we used to lay down
and you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
and you know that this beer won't drink itself
hehehe, oh, oh

unh, since when did you grow up, hello kitty always
was on your bags and your socks, and cooties was always
my fear, now you're all sex and the city on me
so grown, so mature, and so able bodied
to pay yo taxes, take it back to class
when i didn't have no chapstick, i was so average
you were so bright-eyed and still believed in magic
we were so natural, but now we're so plastic
when did we grow up
let's smash the clock and slow up
but if i have to hear one more thing about your business career
i might just throw up
but you showed up
which so proved the old you's in there somewhere
so moved, the old school, into an only past
but let's open a new book as we go pass

i'm staring at old picture frames
i think i kinda miss your face
maybe we could spend the day
remember how we used to lay down
and you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
and you know that this beer won't drink itself
hehehe, oh, oh


da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da
da, da, dada-dum-da, da

oh, i took all your records
then smashed them on the floor
then i came up with this melody
till this baseline shook my floor
and after all the pain you've cause me
i see one things true, true...
oh this song
sounds like me getting over you

now if you with me, stand up and just rock it
her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
this is a public service announcement for those who've fallen
and goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit

oh, i took all your records
then smashed them on the floor
then i came up with this melody
till this baseline shook my floor
and after all the pain you've cause me
i see one things true, true...
oh this song
sounds like me getting over you

like jersey shore, i'm sure i've missed
'cause i'm turning heart-breaking to hits
hit the reset button on the play back
i'm just amazed that, you can erase that
asap out of your mind, it's like ajax
'cause you wipe me clean baby, eight stacks
couldn't pay for this lesson learned
when i hit the dance floor baby, heads will turn
'cause i'm looking good, turn to my bottle and kissed it
'cause a drink looks a lot better than your lipstick

now if you with me, stand up and just rock it
her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
this is a public service announcement for those who've fallen
and goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit


everybody's mad, extra, all the time
i think we need more tracks like this
this is "something2relax2"

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

indian style on top of a waterfall flow
had my whole life in front of me, watched it all go
smoothly on top of the charts
was me all up in my drop
but then my dream level popped
it seems life is always different when we open our eyes
this song goes out to anybody trying to get by
but it's constantly low, so you gotta stay high
if this could help you with your issues, then i need you to vibe
i don't really care for the tough guy image
i'm pretty sure a mother, who is spent but has given
everything to her children, three jobs just for living
doesn't really give a - if i get mad women
skaters to the gangsters, punks to the preps
everybody's got issues and for that i'll rep
don't usually spit but this is something i'll rap to
ego at the door and this is something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

something to relax to
something, something to relax to
something to relax to

whoa-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh

whoa, oh, oh
whoa, oh-ooh-oh


and i'm just trying to rest my head
and a bunch of dark thoughts fall in my head

what if it's not everything i want it to be
what if it sounds real good to me
but it doesn't sound good to him or her or anyone, oh, oh
then it hits me that i really don't mind
but i'd be lying if i said that "i didn't think twice"
and i'ma say something i know i'll regret
but here it goes
we all just want to be loved

see we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see i just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see i just want to be, see i just want to be loved

and everything i do, i swear i'm self-conscious
ridiculous, this is nonsense
and just admitting this, i'm getting kind nauseous
but i am not afraid, i am not afraid...
i am not afraid to admit i just want to be loved

see we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see i just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see i just want to be, see i just want to be loved

i write how i feel and i will spit accordingly
half of y'all are boring me
my tanks filled with thoughts that i ought to get rid of
so i'll pass b, please don't gas me
and i'm just trying to see progress
but y'all don't want to see change
'cause y'all be non-sense, get it?
well maybe you do or maybe you don't like the song
so from the start i've been a fool

see we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see i just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
see i just want to be, see i just want to be loved

how did we end up in this bed then?"
i said "relax" and laughed like
"this would be a pretty dope song."
she's like "no, i swear to god i'll kill you
no, i really will just take your life
no, don't even think about it
but that would be a pretty dope song."
so i came home and i called my friends
then we got smacked and i wrote this jam
i know for a fact that i'm going
it's over, my life is dead ass over

call my doctor, call my lawyer
call my brother, call my priest
there's paperwork to fill out
'cause a dead man walks the streets
'cause my sister has a best friend
that's i've known since i was three
and now i'm gon' get strangled
'cause we tangled in the sheets

the funny thing about this entire thing
you know like doing the one-take, write it quick, fun jokes?
but my sister won't hear this until i release the album
she'll hear every other song except this one
so surprise


it's so empty right where your head sleeps
and she said i still smell your cologne in my bed sheets

so i said i'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
and she said some days i'm okay but when i'm alone it hurts because

loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves


so i said i'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
and she said some days i'm okay but when i'm alone it hurts because

loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

i have to tape my mouth
i want to ask you questions
like do you sleep alone
i heard there's friends you rest with
so i text her friend
like tell me where this man's at
she says you got some balls
you don't deserve to ask that

oh no they gotta be lying
i'm dying to know
but i know you're not mine

so i said i'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
and she said some days i'm okay but when i'm alone it hurts because

loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves


all that ass it was so first class
she was my co-pilot with a mile high swag
i needed her, i know she needed me
if we fly this thing it's gonna take two people
but the storm came fast
got a little rocky, the oxygen mask from the ceiling they were dropping

we started to fall right out the sky
without a warning call. nah-hoo...
we started to fall, no parachute so we had no time to call, for mayday mayday...
we bought two tickets and and a paradise,
one last flight trying make it right
but that's when the rain came,
that's when the pain came
were never ever gonna make it far.
we bought two tickets and a paradise
one last flight tryna make it right
but love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane.
i know we tried to fly away, but we were just a
paper plane.

it's funny how things end up
it's funny how we break it off
relationships they nose dive,
while ones career is taking off.
publishing checks and fake smiles as i see my dad,
my pockets getting filled
but really emptiness is all i have.
we crash, and now there's spare parts.
bandages, and bad scars.
we try to mend broke amelia earharts.
and keep trying to fly on, fly on, fly on.
but i'm missing my right wing
my right arm, and that's you.

we started to fall right out the sky
without a warning call. nah-hoo...

to the rising sun

hey, there, what you doing?
would you like a little company?
hey, man, how you doing?
would you like to sit next to me?

another day is over
another day is done
waiting for the sun

hey, there, what you doing?
would you like a little company?
hey, man, how you doing?
would you like to sit next to me?

well, i don't know, little lady
you're awfully pretty
but i'm a nice man, i live a nice life
i have a nice house, i have a great wife
and i'm tired of making
decisions without thinking

another moon is shining
another evening come
another hour unwinding

hey, man, what you doing?
would you like a little company?
hey, there, how are you doing?
would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?


my momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
but you're under forty and you have a job
my momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
but you're making money and you're working hard so

i'm going to take you out, i don't feel like it's wrong
me and my momma, we don't get along

my momma, she would say your hair was too long
but your hair exactly is what i like the best
and my momma she would say you was a hoodlum
but i don't know no hoodlum and you don't pass the test

i'm going to take you out, i don't feel like it's wrong
me and my momma, we don't get along

oh, baby, i'm standing so close, i can't back down
you're smiling and i know, i'm over and done now
i am done now

my momma say that it was wrong to see you
i lie just to meet you, i lie to get in
and my momma she would say that i deceived you
but that's the only way i knew how to begin

so maybe you got your own problems, who doesn't?
i'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

my momma, she would love you like i love you
if she ever met you, if she ever knew
my momma, she would fall right on top of you
if she'd ever saw you, she'd be smitten, too

i'll never take you home, i want you all for my own
don't let my momma hear your pretty song
i'm going to take you out, i don't feel like it's wrong
me and my momma, we don't get along


well, there is something about watching a crime
it makes me want to go out and make it all mine
it's something about seeing you fight

i got a bad disease
i got a bad disease
to fall into
yeah, it's true

there's something about seeing him die
that puts it all into perspective and i
want to stay home, be left alone
someone make my mind up so i don't have to decide

i got a bad disease
i got a bad disease
to fall into
yeah, i do

there's some reason why i can't sit still
every waking moment i feel so unfulfilled
i try to lie down, but i don't know how
baby, when i'm sleeping, if it's less like i am dreaming

oh, my god
i got a bad disease
i got a bad disease
it's got me down
on my knees

there's a fear i have, a feeling real bad
i'm final if i find out that i'm not i'll be sad
oh, they got me thinking, i'd be happier just drinking

it's not true
and i got a bad disease
i got a bad disease
it's got me down
on my knees
oh, no
i got a bad disease
will no one help me please?
not even you?


little bits and pieces, falling to the corners
box of broken laces, lined up in an order
i'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
i'll tell you the future, you tell me your story

i'm going out with a bang
i'm going out with a bang
i'm going out with a bang

smiles from the stranger, seem to change a day when
you were just about to go and throw your towel in
lately i've been thinking about making changes
it's been on my mind for some time and i'm anxious

i'm going out with a bang
i'm going out with a bang
i'm going out with a bang

scowling like the sunshine, set on sarasota
happy like a twister over oklahoma
clear as penny mason lying in a coma
this is our feeling, all my hurt is over

i'm going out with a bang
i'm going out with a bang
i'm going out with a bang

meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
carry me into the water, now we're drowning

we're going out with a bang
we're going out with a bang
we're going out with a bang
we're going to go home again


you didn't think about anyone else
you didn't think about any of us
when you left that place
you didn't want to go anywhere else
nothing could satisfy you till you left
so you went away

where did you go?
where are you now?
i ask about
so many of my friends
oh, about their ends
what about us?
are we just dust
on the floor again
i thought we were on the mend

you really put me in a quite a position
you got me struggling as a musician
with the song
you like to write about all of your problems
the damning songs because you think it was often
but you're wrong

why did you go?
i guess i know
maybe my question is
why must i come to this?
you talk about
being strong, yeah
how i want to be
you and your melody

trying to learn about something important
you keep taking up space, you're annoying
but i love you so
yeah, you already know
they're trying to teach me about new ways of living
they're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
but you make it hard
you're such a bad, bad boy

i love you anyway
no matter what what they say
you were not approved
but you are on the moon
i care about
how this turns out
it's just more than i
heaven know how to fight
i guess i want
tell me i have to
tell me i have to
i know you couldn't
i said i know you could
where are you now?
i ask about


can't put my finger on it
but i know i want it
i'm willing to try another way
that is, if i get by another day
back and forth, i don't get anywhere
and i've been searching everywhere

happy as the moon shine

cliches find a home inside of him
when he enters all of the lights go dim
he's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
and i'm so sure i can make that man smile

is how he spends all his time

if he could go on without your help
then he would do it all by himself
but i don't think he got strength to muster
and he don't got a lot lack of lustre

but he will, he will, he will, yes, he will


you have a right
to live your life
like no one else does
like no one else might
if you have visions
come on and live them out

all you need
is some peace
while you are here
just let go
till you are home, dear

i had a dream
when i was young
i dreamt our lives were
going to be fun
when we were always
waiting to live

all you need
is some peace
while you are here
just let go
i'll be it all, dear

you have the choice
to hear the noise
or hear the sweet sound
of your sweet voice
i know i've heard it
i heard it in my sleep

all you need
is some peace
while you are here
just let go
don't say no, dear

at the same time
pull up the blind
and look outside
and in the orange light
the fog is rising

this is life
peace in the quiet
happiness
is the sky


what an unusual name you said
what a spectacular redhead
you really seem like a prize to me
and you are so mysterious
when you are not delirious
oh, what you mean to me

and she said, how do you know me so well
how do i love you, tell me
with all of my might

i'm indebted to you
i'm indebted to you
always

there's something she doesn't know about
a secret he doesn't show about
a sensitive sign on his arm, oh, my
she got her skeletons as well
some secrets he knows she'll never tell
people who keep her alone

and she said, how did i know you so well?
why am i not surprised?
he said, baby, go to hell
and that was the demise, of their love

don't ever pick up the man
if you don't think he'll understand
don't ever trust yourself if you
have a history of being a loving fool

so, that's what she got when she married him
a lifetime promise to carry him
him and his every second of need

i do not know him so well
do you still love me, oh, tell me
with all of your might?

i'm indebted to you
i'm indebted to you
my love

a little tired, even more confused
come on, baby, don't be shy
you can say what make you high
i'll see the way you'll be lying, be abused

i don't need anybody when i'm down
i don't really find it hard to get around
i'll find my own way back to town
oh, no, you tell me how i need to be
that ain't up to anybody else but me
i don't care what you think

breathing, getting fire to them

and i don't care what you think


you have this way of making me
say the opposite of everything i mean
i kiss you, i hug you
but i could not feel less connected from you

i know i wanted all this in the beginning, i really tried
i know i caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
my dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

i don't quite fit the part of
she who loses everything and falls into insanity
the sunbeams mean nothing
if you can't find the light shining in one thing

i know i wanted all this in the beginning, i really tried
i know i caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
my dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

it's fine if you're hateful
as long as all in all you remain grateful

it made me nervous to know you didn't like me, i really tried
the way i'm feeling in this moment, it can't last my whole life
my dreams are bigger than your junkie pride


met you in front of the diner and you had blue hair
you were so nice
you were from l.a. but you were all there
you were all right

so many people say that they have it together
but i think you're a nice guy
and i think we could be birds of a feather

met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
i met you with your mother and she had green shoes
she was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

so many people say that they have it together
but i think you're a nice guy
and i think we could be birds of a feather
oh, feather, oh, birds

of a nun who was playing the drums
she was crazy, her name was katie

until you look around and, and you look at the people who
who, who are still trailing so far behind you
and i know that, that no matter what, it's
in the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know
it's not gonna be about my connections

hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
and i only stop for pedestrians
or a real real bad lesbian
hit 'em with the mac, hit 'em with the tec 9
hit 'em with the ruger by the intersex line
put my whole burrough on my back and i'm gooda
i don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
i represent all the girls that stood up
used to drink water with a little bit of sugar
now i'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
now i'm tellin' la reid to step his bid up
and i'm tellin' president carter he picked a winner
these birds all fly south in the winter
you can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
i'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
skirts with the ruffle, louis on the duffle
tell 'em i'm the ninja, weezy is my sensei
so i call him splinter, faster than a sprinter
this is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
this is to my fans, unless i'm feeling kinda cocky
winter wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
i am nicki, minaj or lewinsky
pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed

if you could you would get rid of me
you should already figure i'm a go hard
if you was as real as me, you would never
let another girl sit in yo throne

i'm still lookin' around for my
com-pe-tition. i am gettin' it in until the end
i gotta go, go, go, go hard!

from slap-and-cry you start to die, so i must go harder
if you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
it yee ain't got money, don't come on my strip
and if ya got money, don't cover my strip
i wear that metal, no olympic, but i can still
make you tumble and flip
your girlfriend, her decision is split
and i shoot like i'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "gunovich"
red drank, blue pill, white dust

wish you could get rid of young money
you should already figure i'm a go hard
if you was as real as me you would never
let another girl sit in your throne
i done flipped the trunk on her
they screamin', "nicki leave me alone!"
i am, i will, i gots to win

i am a movie, camera block
you outta work, i know it's tough
but enough is enough

and witty
and gay


i ain't into s&amp;m, but my whip's off the chain
a little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
so wipe the smile on your grill off, i swear to god i'll piss a happy meal off
get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
i ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
life's hard, i swear to god, life is a dumb blonde white broad
with fake tits and a bad dye job
so finally i broke down and bought her an ipod
and caught her stealin' my music, so i tied her arms and legs to the bed
set up the camera and pissed twice on her
look, two pees and a tripod!
the moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
kick it back in its face, my god
it's shady and nicki minaj, you might find the sight quite odd

i feel uglyx3

slut don't touch me or hug me

yuh done know


i wanna get to know you
one dose of my lovin'
i'm simply going to drive you crazy

i wanna be your lover
i wanna get to know you, baby
one dose of my lovin'
i'm really gonna drive you crazy

i'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
swingin' them hips when you pass
i'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
jump on this harley
lets go smoke some of that bob marley
sip some bacardi
then go pull up at the afterparty
i think we make a perfect couple
but you think i'm trouble
maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
she got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
think i'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
your toes painted hair fixed all the time
and your gucci boots the same color as mine
if you read between the lines you can see that i want you
i betcha i have you doin' what you said that you won't do
making decisions shorty good things don't last long
your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
before i head home
i'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn

wonder why i don't call her
maybe because i'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
it gets annoying from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
she loves it when i'm in town
hate it when i'm not around
i get her and wear down
next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hittin' the ground
just enough to hold us down
i'm stickin' 'n' moving cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady

i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call me by my government name
her panties wet over fame
fall in love with my chain
i wonder if i wasn't an entertainer would she remain
surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
i'm not your boyfriend i'm your homie.

watching her lick her lips
i sweet talking her if she like
look i'm legit now used to break laws
now you can reap the benefit of world tours
big house big benz girl it yours
mink coats italian shoes stones with no flaws
you ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
all you gotta do is love me and be loyal
cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
come here let my touch on you i let you touch on me
put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
let me ride on you and you can ride on

i wanna get to know you
i wanna get to know you, baby
one dose of my lovin'
i'm simply gonna drive you, crazy

i wanna be your lover
i wanna get to know you, lady
one dose of my lovin'
i'm really gonna drive you, crazy

i wanna be your lover
i really understand you, baby
i want to be your lover
i really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.


you got spark, you, you got spunk;
you, you got something all the girls want...
you're like a candy store, and i'm a toddler;
you got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
your love, your love... your love, your love...
your love, your love... your love, your love...

uh... uh, yo...
he the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
might breeze through the ave, might stop at the gym,
and he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

anyway, i think i met him sometime before,
in a different life, or where i record...
i mean... he was adam, i think i was eve,
but my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

s-s-s on my chest, 'cause i'm ready to save him,
ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
and i think i love him, i love him just like i raised him;
when he call me "mama", "lil' mama", i call him "baby"...

you got spark, you, you got spunk;
you, you got something all the girls want...
you're like a candy store, and i'm a toddler;
you got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
your love, your love... your love, your love...
your love, your love... your love, your love...

mm-hmm... yo... yo...
he the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
just left money gram in the lemon lam...
hot damn, make me scream like summer jam;

anyway, i think i met him in the sky;
when i was a geisha, he was a samurai...
somehow i understood him when he spoke thai;
never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

s-s-s on my chest, let me get my cape on;
he's so thugged out, ghostface and raekwon...
konvict! just like akon,
'cause you know the snitches be putting the jake-on...

you got spark, you, you got spunk;
you, you got something all the girls want...
you're like a candy store, and i'm a toddler;
you got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
your love, your love... your love, your love...
your love, your love... your love, your love...

find me in the dark, i'll be in the stars;
find me in your heart - i'm in need of your love...
your love... your love, your love...
baby, you're the illest...
your love...

your love...

i got something to say
a confession of me
i've been led astray
tried so hard to change
but i'm set on my ways
my words mean nothing again

i promised i'd be good
but i can't help myself from these temptations
when they come, there's nothing i can do
i promised i'd be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall, i will fall to you

i promised i'd be good
i promised i'd be good

i just couldn't resist
it was the moment of bliss
i know it's hard to forgive
it's too late for changes
all this time i've wasted
words mean nothing, nothing again

i promised i'd be good
but i can't help myself from these temptations
when they come, there's nothing i can do
i promised i'd be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall, i will fall to you

i promised i'd be good
i promised i'd be good

i promised i'd be good
but i can't help myself from these temptations
when they come, there's nothing i can do
i promised i'd be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall, i will fall to you

i promised i'd be good
but i can't help myself from these temptations
when they come, there's nothing i can do
i promised i'd be good
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
so when i fall, i will fall to you


down to my last match fire i'll touch just to feel
why's it easier to burn than it is to heal?

out in the cold you have been
i've begged you to come back in
but i can't do this again

i can't keep you from harm
but i'm set on fire to keep you warm
i can't go on and on
setting fires to keep you warm
i can't keep you from harm
but i'm set on fire to keep you warm
i can't go on and on
setting fires to keep you warm

i can't
i can't go on and on
setting fires to keep you warm

i've been looking for answers i don't want to hear
chest to chest with you i'm staring into a mirror

out in the cold you have been
i've begged you to come back in
but i can't do this again

i can't keep you from harm
but i'm set on fire to keep you warm
i can't go on and on
setting fires to keep you warm

fighting flames of fire
hang onto burning wires
we don't care anymore
are we fading lovers?
we keep wasting colors
maybe we should let this go

we're falling apart, still we hold together
we've passed the end, so we chase forever
'cause this is all we know
this feeling's all we know

i'll ride my bike up to the road
down the streets right through the city
i'll go everywhere you go
from chicago to the coast
you tell me, "hit this and let's go
blow the smoke right through the window"
'cause this is all we know

'cause this is all we know
'cause this is all we know
'cause this is all we know

never face each other
one bed, different covers
we don't care anymore
two hearts still beating
on with different rhythms
maybe we should let this go

we're falling apart, still we hold together
we've passed the end, so we chase forever
'cause this is all we know
this feeling's all we know

i'll ride my bike up to the road
down the streets right through the city
i'll go everywhere you go
from chicago to the coast
you tell me, "hit this and let's go
blow the smoke right through the window"
'cause this is all we know

'cause this is all we know
'cause this is all we know
'cause this is all we know

four years, no calls

out on the terrace
i don't know if it's fair but i thought "how

while i'm wasted with someone else"

to get away from your parents
you look so proud
standing there with a frown and a cigarette
posting pictures of yourself on the internet
out on the terrace
we breathe in the air of this small town
on our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

if we go down then we go down together
they'll say you could do anything
they'll say that i was clever
if we go down then we go down together
we'll get away with everything
let's show them we are better

we were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
fought about anything, everything that did is function
don't let it go like this
maybe we can go from this, yeah

we both know i go too far like when i wrecked your car
and almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
but it's hard when you're young

yeah, it's hard when you're young

caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
i hope that we can go from this, yeah

we both know i go too far like when i wrecked your car
and almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
don't worry, my love, we're learning to love

i'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
you say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

bottom up forbidden essence
twisted up in adolescence
waking up within your arms

gotta keep it on the down low
i'll never let my mama know
only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
i met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
the brotha hada alot a game, and he open from the start
he scoops me up in his ride, friday about a quarter to 9
so fly and so fine, and i'm so glad that he's all mine

she gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
there's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama

i know his crew is kinda shady
sometimes it gets kinda crazy
but he treats me like a lady, gives me everything i need
he's got mad personality, a side they never see
my friends tell me to slow down, but every time that he's around
my heart don't lock down, i feel love and i'm so proud

there's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
she gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
there's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama

t-h-u-g in ya life baby
one in a million that's what you are to me
anda i know your friends say i'm rough
but i still got that tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
but ya mom does not approve of us
she needs to be alot more understanding
'cause all i have for you is thug loving and loving that's all i'm giving

mama don't worry, i'm not in a hurry
i won't disappoint you, i won't make you sorry
we'll be together from now till forever
i know it's the real thing, if you don't whatever
and i know its meant to be

there's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
she gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
there's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama

mama don't worry, i'm not in a hurry
i won't disappoint you, i won't make you sorry


took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
opened up, let you in my world
like a dance, started slow and then love took control
swept away, so proud to be your girl
when you read a story much to fast
sometimes a happy ending doesn't last

now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when this ride is so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know

remember when, we said our love would last forever
but then again, how are we to know
there come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
a sunny day will suddenly turn cold
time will teach you all you need to learn
but there'll always be a first time you get burned

now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when this ride is so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know

i don't regret a single day
joy and pain along the way
a broken heart's the price we pay
as sad as it may seem
baby can't you see
it's the way it's gotta be

now i know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
now i know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when this ride is so amazing
when it's wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know
yeah
now i know
i know

story of my life
searching for the right,
but it keeps avoiding me
sorrow in my soul
'cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company

he's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in
because i'm gone again
and to him i just can't be true

and i know that he knows i'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying

i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door,
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be a murderer

i feel it in the air
as i'm doing my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek
as he reluctantly
ask if i'm gonna be out late

i say i won't be long
just hanging with the girls
a lie i didn't have to tell
because we both know
where i'm about to go
and we know it very well

'cause i know that he knows i'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying

i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door,
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be a murderer

our love,
his trust.
i might as well take a gun and put it to his head
get it over with
i don't wanna do this, anymore
ooh.
anymore

i don't wanna do this anymore
i don't wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i don't wanna hurt him anymore
i don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be a murderer

a murderer
no, no, no
yeah, yeah, yeah

that we spent and i
see it in my mind
playing over and over again

'cause boy right now

and i just can't figure out why
but this is what you say

it's till the day we die

visions in my mind
of the day that we met
you showed me things
that i'll never forget

took me swimming
in the ocean
you had my head up in the clouds
made me feel like i'm floating
you think i'm playing

when you know it's the truth
nobody else can do it quite like i do
all my kisses
and my loving
but ain't nobody better than us

now i look back on the time
that we spent and i
see it in my mind
playing over and over again
'cause boy right now
you got me breaking down
and i just can't figure out why

i'm not concerned with people
'cause they only want to know you, enroll you
only for the things ya had
i just think it's so sad

get dem haters out your circle
smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
see them try to mess to hurt you
and work you
anything to bring ya down

you can't let them knock your hustle
not letting them know how much you struggle
they turn green with envy when your on top
and dem heart is full with strife
their by gonna try to take your life

ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
don't be fooled you betta recognize
they not there for you
they don't care for you
trust me 'cause i know its true
ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
then they turn against you when your not around
its just jealousy and dishonesty
so hold on to your sanity


i never should of waited so long to say
what i've always known since the very first day
thought that you would stay forever with me
but the time has come to leave

before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
i'll tell you a secret i've held all my life
it's you that i live for, and for you i die
so i'll lay here with you till the final goodbye

hold, draw me close, close to my lips
listen intently as i tell you this
outside the world wages its rewards, i'll rest in peace as long as you know

before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
i'll tell you a secret i've held all my life
it's you that i live for, and for you i die
so i'll lay here with you till the final goodbye

promise you our love will carry on
until you turn eternal, we belong

before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
i'll tell you a secret i've held all my life
it's you that i live for, and for you i die
so i'll lay here with you till the final goodbye

what's up?
i know we haven't spoken for a while
but i was thinkin' 'bout you
and it kinda made me smile
so many things to say
and i'll put 'em in a letter
and it might be easier
the words might come out better
how's your mother, how's your little brother,
does he still look just like you?
so many things i wanna know the answers to
wish i could press rewind
and rewrite every line
to the story of me and you

don't you know i've tried and i've tried
to get you out my mind
but it don't get no better
as each day goes by
and i'm lost and confused
i've got nothin' to lose
hope to hear from you soon
p.s. i'm still not over you
still not over you

excuse me, i really didn't mean to ramble on
but there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
i guess you thought that i would put it all behind me
but it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
like a silly joke, or somethin' on the tv
boy it ain't easy
when i hear our song
i get that same old feeling
wish i could press rewind
turn back the hands of time
and i shouldn't be telling you

don't you know i've tried and i've tried
to get you out my mind
but it don't get no better
as each day goes by
and i'm lost and confused
i've got nothin' to lose
hope to hear from you soon
p.s. i'm still not over you
still not over you

did you know i kept all of your pictures
don't have the strength to part with them yet
oh no
tried to erase the way your kisses taste
but some things a girl can never forget

don't you know i've tried and i've tried
to get you out my mind
but it don't get no better
as each day goes by
and i'm lost and confused
i've got nothin' to lose
hope to hear from you soon
p.s. i'm still not over you
still not over you


some girls play the game
they all walk and talk
and they dress the same
nothin' new to say
don't they realize
that it's so easy to see
right though there disguise
makes me wonder why
when the whole worlds turnin' left
it's when i'm goin' right
i need someone to let me be
just who i am inside

'cause a girl like me
is just a lil' different from all the rest
and a girl likes me
never gonna settle for second best
could it be a boy like you
that would give me anything
if i asked him to
to take all my dreams
and make them true
show me all the reasons that you
ought to be with a girl like me
just like me

possibility
got me trippin'
thinkin' of what could be
between you and me
still i need to know
should i keep this feelin'
or let it go
i can't wait no more
so now's the time
to speak your mind
and show me what you feel
so tell me if you
want to take a chance
on something real

'cause a girl like me
is just a lil' different from all the rest
and a girl likes me
never gonna settle for second best
could it be a boy like you
that would give me anything
if i asked him to
to take all my dreams
and make them true
show me all the reasons that you
ought to be with a girl like me
just like me

mirror mirror on the wall
catch me now before i fall
i wish i may, i wish i might
mirror mirror on the wall
catch me now before i fall

here we lay face to face once again
the silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
and i'm wondering who will be the first
to say what we both know
we're just holding on to could have beens
and we should be letting go.

it feels like you're a million miles away
i can't even find the words to say
i can find a way to make it right
and we both know that the story's ending,
we play the part but we're just pretending
and i can hide the tears
cause even though you're here,
it feels like you're a million miles away.

was it me, or was it you that broke away?
from what we were just like the seasons love has changed
and every i think about it
it tears me up inside
like the rivers of emotion but i got no more tears to cry.


we can try to talk it over
but we walked that road before
boy, our song has played its last note
and we both know for sure
that it's time to close that door.

you... you alone

granted you're taking me for a sucker
when i am not
gradually, we'll patch up mends and i'll make you see
what i've got

you've gotta tie me up
eventually you will tamper mends, i'll make you see
i am enough

you only see what you want to see
you only see what you want to
you only see what you want to see
you only see what you want to

obviously, you're taking me for what suits you

how can i climb inside you
the way that you're climbing inside me
how could i ever deny you
the way that you never deny me
how can i climb inside you
touching the parts that people really see
how can i open and find you
and feel you the way that you want me to feel

i want you to know what i'm thinking of
i want you to read my mind before i write it
i want you to know that i have stories to tell
i wanna tell you a little bit more

how do i get to align with you
if we can piece together something
or something else that will be

can't believe that you're less
i'm still not against your will
a change that you really want too
if i pour it all out
will you still have no doubt
there's a reason or two that you are too

i want you to know what i'm thinking of
i want you to read my mind before i write it

will you still have no doubt
there's a reason or two that you are too


your insensitivity is your personality
a trade that's least favourite
ha ha funny, you think you're so funny
but you hurt my feelings
we've had some good dealings
what have i done recently to make you so mean to me?
i'm oversensitive you say but i think you're nasty today
you make me feel nasty like a control freak
i just want to feel helpful like i'm needed
a sense of reason
look how long it took
i've been like this all the time
you don't know what it's like to be me -
you're not paranoid, neurotic - you're free
i don't like me much anymore
you make me feel a burden
you make me feel like a bore


well i live here with you
in, in a kind of "yes, will do"
oh what part of now don't you understand
i'm showing you well apparent
yeah i get the bluff if i'll get out
no room for three, you, me and your doubts
one of us has got to leave
and it'll sure be me

and i think we could have a situation
we could have a situation

any reason we can't just settle around now
yeah, ok, and how?
rather than shout and praise
oh, what part of our old tune don't you understand
i think i made it clear that you're in the mend
in the mend

oh, we could have a situation
oh, we could have a situation


yes, you can take that to heart
it was meant to sit close to the bone anyway
you can make it a big issue
make it a battle of your own and that's ok

you can feign a distant familiarity
you say you understand the similarity
you think you see me with great clarity
but you're acting me, not necessarily

only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

yes, you can call that a start
it was meant to begin kind of slow anyway
yes, your deceit is an art
i knew you would sink kind of low anyway

you say you have the best intentions
you fill me with fickle suggestions
logic is fired by inventions
but your concern is much more than you mention

only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

you say you know my situation
you say you've been confused by my complication
you think my soul makes negotiation
but you don't see my hesitation

only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

people are talking, well that's nothing new
and some things will never change
stories are turning away from the truth
but people will stay the same

to meet with the days that will come
it's only natural that we all carried forward
so step on, go on

i sometimes believe that everything i dream
will one day be my reality
i sometimes think that every move i make
will gather in shape in my reality

i can only dream
i can only hope
that one day i will see
a beautiful reality
i can only wish
and i can only want
that one day i will see
a beautiful reality

i sometimes search for signs my dreams can work
until i stand alert with my reality
i sometimes look in paradise by the book
to give back what i took from my reality

i can only dream
i can only hope
that one day i will see
a beautiful reality
i can only wish

like a new winter's coat
i'm wearing your last embrace
like a cold quenching glass of water
i hold a clear picture of your face

where are you?
soon i'll be cold and thirsty
soon i'll be cold and thirsty

i'm hearing your last telephone call
ringing louder and clearer than the rest
i hear your invitation to see it all
better written i am smitten no protest

where are you?
soon i'll be bored and lonely
soon i'll be bored and lonely

like a story well told
your conversation can hold me or soothe me
like a funny time to share you were there
and your comfort and support me

where are you?
soon i'll be restless and weary
soon i'll be restless and weary

like another man
i want hold you within me
like a good day without care
i just want you to last
i just want you to last

i'm tasting the last glass of your wine
the sweet taste linger left on lips
i think of your kisses with mine
the sweet taste lingers left on lips

where are you?
soon i'll be sober and unkissed
soon i'll be sober and unkissed


i, i, i never would have thought it would end this way, i lied
i never have believed that we would separate
what we have now is how it stands
and now i wish you'll try to make it stay
the way we are is here and now
i wish you'd make the most of all we have today

before you go and give it away
hold on for one more shot
before you let it slip away
hold on for one more shot

i did not believe, i did not mean to hurt you no more
i never meant to let you down, down
though the silver lining wears through
i still do not mean to hurt you, no
when the sound of your voice is not ringing through
beginning to question whether i should be around

before you go and give it away
hold on for one more shot
before you let it slip away
hold on for one more shot

before you go and give it away
hold on for one more shot
before you let it slip away
hold on for one more shot


my mother's afraid of the subway
it's a living bad dream
i hold her hand as the doors close
and she pales and stifles a scream

ali's afraid of ad-libbing
of improvising at jams
she is not very happy right now
and spends all her money on grams

ade is afraid of commitment
so carla dumped him today
she is very disappointed
she was hoping he'd beg her to stay

ayo, he just wants a girlfriend
he's afraid of dying alone
he doesn't go out very much
sits at home a lot getting stoned

you see, fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear, it is fear, it is fear

ella is worried about her weight
she won't eat in public anymore
when they've finished, she sleeps on the floor

nate has a heart of gold
but give it away he will not
his mother abandoned him at ten
it's a pain he has never forgot

mary's afraid of herself
her sentences often cut half
she will never give her own opinion
she's afraid that people might laugh

and i am afraid of sharks
i will not swim out past my head
and sometimes i worry my boyfriend will die
my first love is already dead

you see, fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear, it is fear, it is fear

you see, fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear, it is fear, it is fear

candy is having a baby
she fears she will be like her mom
her friends say, "relax, take a deep breath
and march to a different drum"

sachas afraid of her marco
she think's that it's all her fault
but if he did what he does to a stranger
he'd be locked up and charged with assault

you see, fear is only holding us back
look closely amongst all your peers
there is usually one thing that keeps us off track
it is fear, it is fear, it is fear


eat food to satisfy my hunger
i drink water to quench my thirst
use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
and prick with pin to watch it burst
to make noise i use my breathe
to unlock doors i use a key
when i'm looking for something i use my eyes
use booze to unlock me

sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep

wear shoes so i can run
as to avoid the broken glass
wear the pants because they suit me
and to discourage the pinchin' of ass
i'll tell a joke to make you laugh
i'll close the door to have a cry
they say that change and pain is a positive thing
have i changed since you died

sweep sweep sweep sweep sweep

don't ask my why i smoke i don't know


i'm sitting in the car again
waiting for you
you said you'd be a minute
but you've been twenty two
see you've got to do your hair
and get it just right
sometimes you're in the bathroom

and i'm waiting for you again
yes i'm waiting for you
and i'm waiting for you again
tell me what can i do
and i'm waiting for you again
yes i'm waiting for you
and i'm waiting for you again
tell me what can i do

now i'm sitting by the phone again
waiting for your call
you said you'd phone at two
and it's a quarter past four
now i'm standing out the front again
and i'm truly sick to death of sleazy men
undressing me with their eyes

and i'm waiting for you again
yes i'm waiting for you
and i'm waiting for you again
tell me what can i do
and i'm waiting for you again
yes i'm waiting for you
and i'm waiting for you again
tell me what can i do

so i'm back from the theater
i watched the show alone
see, i waited for you and i missed half act one
have you never heard of the phone?
i don't like being taken for granted
i'm too nice for my own good
you see i do what i say, and i say what i do
is it too much to expect that you could?
i wish you would

i ain't waiting for you no more
i ain't waiting for you
i ain't waiting for you no more
go find another fool
i ain't waiting for you no more
i ain't waiting for you
i ain't waiting for you no more
it's the usual coup
i ain't waiting for you no more
i ain't waiting for you
i ain't waiting for you no more
i ain't missing nothing for you
i ain't waiting for you no more
i ain't waiting for you
i ain't waiting for you no more
go find another fool


without a sound ever heard
without a lesson i've learned
you're foolish
and diluted

too many lies have you burned
where there's eyes to be found
this seems life's underground

but even if you had it all
you would find
i could never let you stay

'cause you blow it all away
blow it all away
blow it all away

if you go
i will stall

yes i see it
yes i feel it
you have no questions at all

but if life is truly devoured
i'll strip your bare 'til truth comes out

but even if you had it all
you would find
you blow it all

you blow it all away
blow it all away
blow it all away

forever is your mind to be naive
remember
it will bring us to our knees
you blow it all away

'cause even if you had it all
you would find
you blow it all

you blow it all away
blow it all away
blow it all away


now i don't mind if you find that i'm a shoulder to cry on rely on
but the burden is just too much i'm losing touch with myself and my health

what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me
what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me

now i don't keep you from your sleep i need some ease i'm tired of trying to please
and it seems that my dreams are coming farther and fewer in between

what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me
what you gonna do if you get me i can heal your problems if you let me


you took me for granted
you took me, you took me for granted
but i landed back on my feet, back on
my feet
'cause you don't deserve me, deserve me
you don't have the time that i need
that i want, i deserve
but i got back my nerve
did what was right for me
i'm using my head not my heart
and i'm starting new
i'm going to get over you, over you

i'm not important to you
i'm not important to you
i'm not important to you
i'm not important to you

you happy is all i wanted to see, is all
i wanted to see, to see
and so now that's what
i'm going to be, what i'm going to be
i'll waste some time on me
i gave you my all and you took it
i saw and you gave nothing back
your mind on another track,
another track, another track yeah
there are plenty of people out there
who would care about me
you'll see
you'll see

i'm not important to you
i'm not important to you
i'm not important to you
i'm not important to you


like a new winters coat
i'm wearing your last embrace
like cool quenching glass of water
i hold a clear picture of your face

oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
'cause soon, i'll be cold and thirsty
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
'cause soon, i'll be cold and thirsty

i'm hearing your last telephone call
ringing louder and clearer than the rest
i hear your invitation to see it all
better written i am smitten, no protest

oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
'cause soon, i'll be bored and lonely
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
'cause soon, i'll be bored and lonely

i'm tasting the last glass of your wine
the sweet taste lingers, left on lips
i'm tasting your sweet kisses with mine
the sweet taste lingers, left on lips

so, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
'cause soon, i'll be sober and unkissed
oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around
'cause soon, i'll be sober and unkissed

oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around

oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around

oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around

oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around

oh, when are you coming around
oh, when are you coming around


'cause soon, i'll be sober and unkissed


healing is difficult
often results in psychosomatic
i admit to enjoying drugs
they get rid of tension, boredom and static
hate those adverse side effects
forcing the people who love me to scatter
excuse me for being such a hypocrite
the way i see it really doesn't matter

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

to tell you the truth
i can't believe i love you so much
so much in fact that i don't know whether to weep or wind my watch
i have a sick sense of humor
it amazes me how points it scores
i'm addicted to vice
my best friends are pushers, my boyfriends are whores

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

simple to see why i breathe
no one bothers me completely

simple to see why i breathe
no one bothers me completely

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

waking up next to you
your morning breath reminds me of lucy
the flies in the front room
buzz round my head and try to seduce me
if i contract illness
the last thing i want is to pass it to others
when i start forgetting the names of my lovers

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?


judge me feel free
'cause the freer you feel
the freer you'll let me be

it's such a terrible terrible shame
you keep on judging me, in his name
you're so quick to shift the focus
'cause you can find yourself
in today's frame
but i know he's approve
and i've nothing to prove to you
he smiles down on me lovingly

just me feel free
'cause the freer you feel
the freer you'll let me be

it's truly sad to see
you suffering so immensely
you need distracting
so you use me conveniently
but i know he'd approve
and i've nothing to prove to you
he smiles down on me lovingly

you tickle me pink
i love the way you think
so when i'm feeling low i know
i'm your greatest fan

little man i'm endlessly proud of you
in such a short time span
you've filled my heart with joy
as i grow older, you grow wiser
watching my mistakes
memorise where i've gone wrong

if they fall way
i'll stay with you
but do as i say and not as do
trust me and you'll see
all i want is what is best for you

little man yor head is full of dreams
if only i could spend one day touring
your imagination
if i live longer you'll grow faster
at recognising the traps that cause
me such frustration

i'll stay with you
but do as i say and not as i do
trust me and you'll see
all i want is what is best for you

how you been feeling
it's not about marbles, snakes or glue
how you been healing
now that we cannot win or lose
so how you been keeping
it doesn't matter whose dad's richest now
how you been sleeping
from the top bunks further to fall down

you turned that around on me
you turned that around on me
you turned that around on me
you turned that around on me

what you been doing
still making the world a better place
never stopped rueing
making those tears fall down your face
making you suffer
wondering how you got your scars
and only in hindsight
i wish i had taken you in my arms

taken you in my arms
taken you in my arms
taken you in my arms
taken you in my arms

you turned that around on me
you turned that around on me
you turned that around on me
you turned that around on me
you turned that around on me


she cooks you sweet potato, you don't like aubergine
she knows to boil the kettle when you hum bars from grease
she senses you are lonely but still she can't be sure
and so she stands and waits, stands anticipating your thoughts

how can she become the psychic that she longs to be
to understand you
how can she become the psychic that she longs to be
to understand you

he brushes thoroughly
he knows she likes fresh breath
he rushes to the station
he waits atop the steps
he's brought with a mars bar
she will not buy nestle
and later he'll perform
a love-lorn serenade, a trade

how can he become the psychic that he longs to be
to understand you
how can he become the psychic that he longs to be
to understand you

so give her information to help her fill her holes
give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled
help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in
give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin

now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest
i am a martyr and a victim and i need to be caressed
i hate that you negate me i'm a ghost at beck and call
i'm fading and placating, berate myself for staying

i'm a fool
i'm a fool

he greets this stranger meekly a thing that she accepts
she sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps
he senses she is lonely, she's glad they finally met
they take each other's hands, walk into the sunset

do you like sweet potato


faint light of dawn
i'm listening to you breathing in and out
needing nothing
you're honey dipped
you are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world
i can't feel my lips
i'm going down, i don't want to change
i'm going down, going down the drain

don't bring me down, i beg you
don't bring me down, i won't let you
don't bring me down

then all of that's annulled and i'm anyone's
everyone's, we are one
your face becomes the sun
and i'm addicted to the joy that the little things
those little things
the little things they bring

i'm going down, i don't want to change
i'm going down, going down the drain

don't bring me down, i beg you
don't bring me down, i won't let you
don't bring me down

i'm coming from a different phase
when i'm with you

drinking and flowing and rolling
we're falling down

red eyes, amnesia, on ice

right now i'm emotional
i lose control, when i'm with you
i hope i haven't said too much
guess i always push my luck when i'm with you

run away now
like we're supposed to do
take you to the back now
i take a shot for you
gone for every song

drunk all summer
drunk all summer
we be drunk all summer
drinking and flowing and rolling
we're falling down

can your heart be mine in search?
'cause i have no time to help you find
all the words
melodies and memories
stories that sound absurd
i will tell no lies

as long as you look me in the eyes
i'll go wherever you are
i'll follow behind

heard about all the things you've done
and all the walls that you've been in
heard about all the love you lost
it was over before it began
heard about all the miles you've gone
just to start again
heard about all that you've been through
it sounds like you need a friend, a friend

please don't wait
i wanna love you but i can't

as long as you look me in the eyes
i'll go wherever you are
i'll follow behind

heard about all the things you've done
and all the walls that you've been in
heard about all the love you lost
it was over before it began
heard about all the miles you've gone
just to start again
heard about all that you've been through
it sounds like you need a friend, a friend

i never doubted myself
but i doubted you
i'm tired of looking by myself
and not with you

heard about all the things you've done
and all the walls that you've been in
heard about all the love you lost
it was over before it began
heard about all the miles you've gone
just to start again
heard about all that you've been through
it sounds like you need a friend, a friend


oh when i, in the same light
show me in the same light
feels right, come and take flight
clothes off and she so soft
this ain't a fair fight, yeah
what a shared love
only so dry
i'll get her wetter than ever
four letters is never the question
she likes when i'm messy
and i like when she's undressing

you're looking in the wrong place for my love
don't think because you're with me this is real
you're looking in the wrong place for my love
don't stop what you're doing 'cause i like that too

here with you 'cause you got the right vibe
seems like you probably gotta do mine
but it's gotta be the right time
i see through your demeanor
baby i'm a pleaser
i go out my way to treat you
but i can't be a teacher
'cause i'm a problem with problems
i know who i am and i'm not no good
i thought you understood
baby some people are meant to be loved and others just naked
so take what i'm willing to give and love it or hate it

you're looking in the wrong place for my love
don't think because you're with me this is real
you're looking in the wrong place for my love
don't stop what you're doing 'cause i like that too

i don't, i don't really know
i don't, i don't really care
maybe keep it on the low
with stories i don't wanna share

you're looking in the wrong place for my love
don't think because you're with me this is real
you're looking in the wrong place for my love
don't stop what you're doing 'cause i like that too


this love is tainted
i need you and i hate it
you're caught between a dream and a movie scene
in a way, you know what i mean
when the darts just miss, i just can't resist it

'cause i'm a fool for you and the things you do
'cause i'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
the things you do, the things you do

when you're looking like this
i just can't resist it
i know sometimes i hide it
but i can't this time 'cause it's gonna defeat me
but if you won't believe me, believe me

'cause i'm a fool for you and the things you do
'cause i'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
the things you do, the things you do

i know, i know given a chance i'd do it again
'cause i can't help myself
'cause i can't stop myself
i just love being a fool for you

'cause i'm a fool for you and the things you do
'cause i'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
the things you do, the things you do

this love is tainted

don't know how many times
i had to say this to you
this ain't my scene
this wasn't my dream
it was all yours
and of course
i got caught up in this game
and you know i won't say names
of who's to blame

i'm sipping pink
lucozade
we're blazing on that new found haze
i'm seeing in the blacks and grays
i'm hoping that the basket sways
does that make it right for smoke
seeing the pain inside in this house of fear

you don't even wanna know about the things i hear
i'm just wishing it's ambition that got you
your position
you'll be fishing for far too long
you're the bad guy in this movie
and i ain't wrong, i don't breathe the pollution
and it ain't about who's winning or losing

it's 'bout the path you're choosing
time heals pain and promotes self-soothing
when the scars are gone you can't see bruising
wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings
i'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring
a lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity
traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me

bulls eye you the dot to me
emotions splattered, same pattern
can't even begin to spot 'em
no lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth

she's older, i told her
we ain't meant to be
it takes two not three, but i'm here any way
i hope he's leaving soon
started not to see the elephant in this room
disguise is your perfume
but the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind
you can search the world but you will never find
i see everything you've done to me
be there, you run to me
i don't need to pace, i don't need the stamina
kept runnin'
outwit, 'cause you cunnin'
that outfit 'cause you stunnin'
begging 'cause i'm losing mage
got me feeling some type of way i can't explain
i think i got it wrong
when i told you i was over you, or were you under me?


i can taste it on your mouth
and i can't leave it
you're a freak like me
can't you see?
we can work this something out
and i'm believin'
you get off on me
it's like cheating

i, i, i, i just want to watch you when you take it off
take off all your makeup when you take it off
i just want to watch you when you take it off
take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off

put you up against the wall
don't take it easy
you like it hard like me
it's what you need
let's get naked and explore
our inner secrets
for what it is
it's what it is

i, i, i, i just want to watch you when you take it off
take off all your makeup when you take it off
i just want to watch you when you take it off
take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off

i found my life in between shots and getting high
the cage i was in fell away when she asked me to dance again
i found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
the dust settled down, now i can see through the crowd

surrounding your colored eyes

i light her like dynamite
load her like gigabyte
i wanna see you bright

remember when we swam in the ocean?
now we know what's deep inside
remember when we ran in the open?
now we know what's in the wild
used to think that this love was heaven sent
how did we get lost? can't get back again
tell me, is there light on the outside?

so are we leaving this garden of eden?
are we leaving this garden of eden?

used to walk around your apartment
with nothing, but a smile on me
isn't it so clear to see?
nothing's ever perfect in paradise
don't know what it's worth till you pay the price
when you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

so are we leaving this garden of eden?
are we leaving this garden of eden?
now i know what i know
but it's hard to find the meaning
where do we go?
'cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
this garden of eden

i have cried for you, and i'll ride for you
i would die for you, would you do that for me?
tell the truth, what you wanna do
is it me and you?
are you with me, honey?
i have cried for you, and i'll ride for you
i would die for you, would you do that for me?
tell the truth, what you wanna do
is it me and you?
are you with me?

so are we leaving this garden of eden?
are we leaving this garden of eden?
now i know what i know
but it's hard to find the meaning
where do we go?
'cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
this garden of eden

remember when we swam in the ocean?
now we know what's deep inside
remember when we ran in the open?

so are we leaving?
are we leaving?
now i know what i know
but it's hard to find the meaning
where do we go?
'cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
this garden of eden


maybe one day i can see you
we can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
maybe one day it'll be cool
we could just be friends without the complications that it brings
when we start saying things
yeah, i hurt you, and you hurt me
yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
and we tried hard just to fix it
but we broke it more
and so i guess some things are not meant to last
is it too much to ask?

why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh

in a dark room
we don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
we can stay blind in the meantime
let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
even though it's too late

why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh
no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh

maybe one day i'll see you
just smile and wave and be okay

let's love like there's no goodbyes
why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh
no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh


3 am and my neighbours hate me
music blasting, shaking these walls
this time mary-jane won't save me

i've been working later
i've been drinking stronger
i've been smoking deeper
but the memories won't stop

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

like poison coursing through me
so clear, my vision is blurred
the haze won't put my mind out it

i've been sleeping later
i've been breathing stronger
i've been digging deeper
but the memories won't stop

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

say it before you run outta time
say it before it's too late
say what i am feeling, oh
waiting is insane

i can't stop thinking 'bout you

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you

why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
i never did anything, but you closed the doors
slammed shut on me
something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
i won't compete

i'm just like you
maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
there's room for 2
you should've never done something like that to someone
you can't undo
thought you were under the radar
but under the chaos i see through

up and down, it all comes back around

and this baby ain't no fair
taking up my youth
you've been telling me some lies
i've been thinking it's the truth
but i see it in your eyes
the things that you do

i don't wanna waste more time all alone
want somewhere to go
something to call my own
and i ain't satisfied
when you go
outside of the road, washed up on the shore

and i've been through mountains and seas
tryina get you to come back to me
and i've been far and i've been so deep
now i find it harder, and harder to breathe
and i need some new love, new love, new love

even though i found a way
i still come back
know there's nothing more to say
it's all been said
i've been trying to explain
nothing we hide
to all of my friends who say
that i've gone mad

i don't wanna waste more time all alone
want somewhere to go
something to call my own
and i ain't satisfied
when you go
outside of the road, washed up on the shore

and i need some new love, new love, new love
easy come, easy go, why?
i've been living on, living on
living on, give it all, give it all
can't i just let it go?

'cause i wait for a miracle
i wait for a miracle, yeah!
and i've been through mountains and seas
tryina get you to come back to me
and i've been far and i've been so deep
now i find it harder, and harder to breathe
and i need some new love, new love, new love


know you're bad for me, but you know i am too
me and you together like a loved up bruise
i'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
no, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
you see that we got the same pain, same scar
felt that when we got closer in the dark

baby, when, when you're far away
i promise you i'll be good
i guess we're misunderstood
so baby, please, don't hear what people say
'cause i've heard things 'bout you too
makes me know that i'm for you

oh, no, i don't care what's been done here before me
i don't give a damn just as long as you care
cause, baby, i've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
you don't need to ask 'cause i'm already there
let's be bad together, baby, you and i
let's be bad together, if only for a while
let's be bad together, make the devil smile

but it's too late now
so save it, get gone, shut up
'cause if you think i care about you now

i remember that weekend
when my best friend caught you creepin'
you blamed it all on the alcohol
so i made my decision
'cause you made your bed, sleep in it
play the victim and switch your position
i'm through, i'm done

so i cut you off
i don't need your love
'cause i already cried enough
i've been done

something that money can't buy
fighting to fifths
biting your lip

tell me i'm too crazy
you can't tame me, can't tame me
tell me i have changed
but i'm the same me, old same me
inside
hey!

if you don't like the way i talk, then why am i on your mind?
if you don't like the way i rock, then finish your glass of wine
we fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
guaranteed, i can blow your mind
mwah!

guaranteed, i can blow your mind, mwah
guaranteed, i can blow your mind, mwah

yeah, i'm so bad

now it's getting quiet here
now it's getting blue
and this baby ain't no fair
taking up my youth
you've been telling me some lies
i've been thinking it's the truth
but i see it in your eyes
the things that you do

i don't wanna waste more time all alone
want somewhere to go
something to call my own
and i ain't satisfied
when you go
outside of the road, washed up on the shore

and i've been through mountains and seas
tryina get you to come back to me
and i've been far and i've been so deep
now i find it harder, and harder to breathe
and i need some new love, new love, new love

even though i found a way
i still come back
know there's nothing more to say
it's all been said
i've been trying to explain
nothing we hide
to all of my friends who say
that i've gone mad

i don't wanna waste more time all alone
want somewhere to go
something to call my own
and i ain't satisfied
when you go
outside of the road, washed up on the shore

and i need some new love, new love, new love
easy come, easy go, why?
i've been living on, living on
living on, give it all, give it all
can't i just let it go?

'cause i wait for a miracle
i wait for a miracle, yeah!
and i've been through mountains and seas
tryina get you to come back to me
and i've been far and i've been so deep
now i find it harder, and harder to breathe
and i need some new love, new love, new love


maybe one day i can see you
we can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
maybe one day it'll be cool
we could just be friends without the complications that it brings
when we start saying things
yeah, i hurt you, and you hurt me
yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
and we tried hard just to fix it
but we broke it more
and so i guess some things are not meant to last
is it too much to ask?

why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh

in a dark room
we don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
we can stay blind in the meantime
let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
even though it's too late

why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh
no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh

maybe one day i'll see you
just smile and wave and be okay

let's love like there's no goodbyes
why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh
no goodbyes
no goodbyes
no goodbyes, eh


3 am and my neighbours hate me
music blasting, shaking these walls
this time mary-jane won't save me

i've been working later
i've been drinking stronger
i've been smoking deeper
but the memories won't stop

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

like poison coursing through me
so clear, my vision is blurred
the haze won't put my mind out it

i've been sleeping later
i've been breathing stronger
i've been digging deeper
but the memories won't stop

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

say it before you run outta time
say it before it's too late
say what i am feeling, oh
waiting is insane

i can't stop thinking 'bout you

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you

i can't stop thinking 'bout you
i can't get high
i can't get by
i can't get through
i can't stop thinking 'bout you


up and down, it all comes back around
push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you

why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
i never did anything, but you closed the doors
slammed shut on me
something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
i won't compete
you're like a king with a crown looking down
hoping i want it

up and down, it all comes back around
push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you

push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you

remember what it felt like to start the climb
i'm just like you
maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
there's room for 2
you should've never done something like that to someone
you can't undo
thought you were under the radar
but under the chaos i see through

up and down, it all comes back around
push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you
up and down, it all comes back around
push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you

i hope that one day you will change
see, everyone ain't the same
we're more than machines
you saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
and you barely remember my name
do you feel complete?

up and down, it all comes back around
push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you
up and down, it all comes back around
push and shove, do you feel better now?
knock, knock, knock
you'll come tumblin' down
karma's got a kiss for you

and i know that you miss me when i'm gone
we make a great team
with you, i'm better than i've ever been

remember when we swam in the ocean?
now we know what's deep inside
remember when we ran in the open?

used to think that this love was heaven sent
how did we get lost? can't get back again
tell me, is there light on the outside?

so are we leaving this garden of eden?
are we leaving this garden of eden?

used to walk around your apartment
with nothing, but a smile on me
isn't it so clear to see?
nothing's ever perfect in paradise
don't know what it's worth till you pay the price
when you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

so are we leaving this garden of eden?
are we leaving this garden of eden?
now i know what i know
but it's hard to find the meaning
where do we go?
'cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
this garden of eden

i have cried for you, and i'll ride for you
i would die for you, would you do that for me?
tell the truth, what you wanna do
is it me and you?
are you with me, honey?
i have cried for you, and i'll ride for you
i would die for you, would you do that for me?
tell the truth, what you wanna do
is it me and you?
are you with me?

maybe i need some rehab
or maybe just need some sleep
i got a sick obsession
i'm seeing it in my dreams

i'm looking down every alley
i'm making those desperate calls
hit my head against the wall

won't listen to any advice
mom's telling me i should think twice
but love to my own devices
i'm addicted, it's a crisis

my friends think i've gone crazy
my judgment's getting kinda hazy
my esteem is gonna be affected
if i keep it up like a lovesick crack-head

what you got boy is hard to find
i think about it all the time
i'm all strung out, my heart is fried
i just can't get you off my mind

because your love, your love
your love is my drug
your love, your love, your love
i said your love, your love
your love is my drug
your love, your love, your love

i don't care what people say
the rush is worth the price i pay
i get so high when you're with me
but crash and crave you when you leave

do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
do i make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
is my love, huh your drug?
your drug, huh your drug
huh your drug, is my love your drug?

because your love, your love
your love is my drug
your love, your love, your love
i said your love, your love
your love is my drug

i like your beard


before i leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of jack

i'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
boys blowing up our phones, phones
drop-topping, playing our favorite cds
pullin' up to the parties
trying to get a little bit tipsy

don't stop, make it pop
dj, blow my speakers up
till we see the sunlight

tik tok on the clock
but the party don't stop, no
oh, woah, oh, oh

and now the sun is rising
there's just so many faces,

in the dark i can fight it, i fight till i'm numb
but in the bright light,
i taste you on my tongue

now the party's over
and everybody's gone
i'm left here with myself and i wonder what went wrong
and now my heart is broken
like the bottles on the floor
does it really matter?
or am i just hung over you?
ah ah ah, ah ah ah
or am i just hungover?

even my dirty laundry
and now my head is throbbing
every song is out of tune
just like you

in the dark i can fight till it disappears
but in the daylight
i taste you in my tears

and now the party's over,
and everybody's gone
i'm left here with myself and i wonder what went wrong
and now my heart is broken
like the bottles on the floor
does it really matter?
or am i just hung over you?
ah ah ah, ah ah ah
or am i just hungover?

now i've got myself looking like a mess
standing alone trying to pretend but no,
i put up my fight
'cause i'm here in the end, tryin' to pretend
i'm here in the end, tryin' to pretend
oh, oh

and now the party's over,
and everybody's gone
i'm left here with myself and i wonder what went wrong

like the bottles on the floor
does it really matter?
or am i just hung over you?
ah ah ah, ah ah ah
or am i just hungover?

bored, stoned, sitting in your basement
all alone, 'cause your little conversations
got around, now lookie what we all found out
lookie what we all found out

that you have got a set of loose lips
twisting stories, all because you're jealous
now i know exactly what you're all about


run your mouth more than anyone i've ever known


i'm sick and tired of hearing all about my life
from other people with all of your lies
wrapped up so tight, so maybe you should shut your mouth

honestly, i think it's kinda funny
that you waste your breath talking about me
got me feeling kinda special, really
this is what you're all about


run your mouth more than anyone i've ever known

katie's to the left, repping my style
damn, jeanie, why you gotta tell the secrets 'bout my sex life?
all i ever did was drive your broke ass around
pick you up, take you out
when your car broke down



run your mouth more than anyone i've ever known

talk talk talk
you're looking like a lunatic

you're looking like a lunatic
everybody knows


i think you got the best of me
you're sleepin' with the enemy
you left me all alone, alone, alone, alone
the beat drops, i'm so lone
my heart stops, i already know
you left me all alone, alone, alone, alone

i'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
never gonna catch me cry
oh whoa whoa
you must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me till the day you die
oh whoa whoa
without me, you're nothing
oh whoa whoa
you must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me till the day you die
oh whoa whoa

i've let go, finally over you
this drama that you put me through
i'm better all alone, alone, alone, alone
the beat drops, you're so lone
it's last call and it's gotten old
now look who's all alone, alone, alone, alone

i'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
never gonna catch me cry
oh whoa whoa
you must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me till the day you die
oh whoa whoa
without me, you're nothing
oh whoa whoa
you must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me till the day you die
oh whoa whoa

i trusted you, you were the first
then you lied and it gets worse
you broke me down
now just look around
who's all alone?
who's all alone now?

i'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
never gonna catch me cry
oh whoa whoa
you must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me till the day you die
oh whoa whoa
without me, you're nothing
oh whoa whoa
you must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me till the day you die

i miss your soft lips
i miss your white sheets
i miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek
and this is so hard
'cause i didn't see
that you were the love of my life
and it kills me
i see your face in
strangers on the street
i still say your name when i'm talking in my sleep
and in the limelight
i play it off fine
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

they say that true love hurts
well this could almost kill me
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

the life is fading from me
while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

remember the time
we jumped the fence when
the stones were playing and we were too broke to get in
you held my hand and
they made me cry while
or when you took me
across the world we
promised that this would last forever but now i see
it was my past life
a beautiful time
drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

oh oh oh oh
drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

they say that true love hurts
well this could almost kill me
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

the life is fading from me
while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

it was my past life
a beautiful time
drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

they say that true love hurts
well this could almost kill me
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone

the life is fading from me
while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered
that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone


i'm in love all right
with my crazy beautiful life
with the parties, the disasters
with my friends all pretty and plastered
wakin' up on a different couch
yeah, i guess we're doing all right

oh oh oh
we're fallin' in love
oh oh oh
'til the sun's comin' up
oh oh oh
just livin' the life

he said the way my blue eyes shined
i said, "that's a lie"
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck

and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

september saw a month of tears
and thankin' god that you weren't here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back

it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
and lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

and i'm back for the first time since then
i'm standin' on your street
and there's a letter left on your doorstep

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
oh, think of me, mmm

he said the way my blue eyes shine
i said, "that's a lie"


state the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
that's fine, i'll tell mine you're gay
by the way...

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

there's no time for tears
i'm just sitting here planning my revenge
there's nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

and if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard, i really really hate that...

stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

burn, burn, burn, baby burn
you're just another picture to burn
baby, burn...


drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing, everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
that i can't even see anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight, give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see


i don't know what i want,
so, don't ask me,
'cause i'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road
i'm just walking,
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i'm not the only one,
who feels the way i do

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl,
trying to find a place in this world

got the radio on
my old blue jeans,
and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today,
got the sunshine,
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrow's just a mystery,
oh yeah, but, that's okay

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl,
trying to find a place in this world

maybe i'm just a girl,
on a mission
but, i'm ready to fly

i'm alone,
on my own,
and that's all i know
i'll be strong,
i'll be wrong,
oh, but life goes on

oh, i'm alone,
on my own
and that's all i know
oh, i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

oh, i'm just a girl
oh, i'm just a girl
oh, i'm just a girl


you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take, you take the very best of me
so, i start a fight 'cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted

oh, what a shame
what a rainy ending,
given to a perfect day
just walk away,
ain't no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through,
i've never been anywhere cold as you

you put up walls,
and paint them all a shade of grey
and i stood there loving you,
and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story,
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

oh, what a shame
what a rainy ending,
given to a perfect day
so, just walk away,
ain't no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through,
i've never been anywhere cold as you

you never did give a damn thing, honey
but i cried, cried for you
and i know you wouldn't have told nobody,
if i died, died for you, died for you

oh, what a shame
what a rainy ending,
given to a perfect day
oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through,
i've never been anywhere cold as you


i didn't know,
what i would find,
when i went lookin' for a reason
i know,
i didn't read,
between the lines,
and baby i've got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right?

so how can i ever,
try to be better
nobody ever,
let's me in
and i can still see you,
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

you saw me there,
but never knew
that i would give it all just to be
a part of this,
a part of you
and now it's all too late
so you see,
you could have helped if you had wanted to
but, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

so how can i ever,
try to be better
nobody ever,
let's me in
and i can still see you,
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

oh, yeah
how can i ever,
try to be better
nobody ever,
let's me in
and i can still see you,
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

oh oh
ah, oh oh
oh oh
oh oh


seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
but, that's not true 'cause i know you

hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high and you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows,
that you cry,
but, you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but, you're coming undone

i guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
it's not his price to pay

hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high and you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows,
that you cry,
but, you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but, you're coming undone

hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high and you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows,
that you cry,
but, you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but, you're coming undone
you're tied together with a smile
but, you're coming undone

goodbye, baby,
with a smile
baby, baby, oh


cory's eyes are like a jungle
he smiles it's like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
there's pretty girls on every corner
they watch his as he's walking home
saying does he know
will you ever know?

you're beautiful
every little piece, love
don't you know you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
i'm taking pictures in my mind
so, i can save them for a rainy day
it's hard to make conversation,
when he's takin' my breath away
i should say,
hey, by the way

you're beautiful
every little piece, love
don't you know you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh, but, if it don't
stay beautiful

if you and i are a story,
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream,
i'll never get to hold
at least you'll know

you're beautiful
every little piece, love
don't you know you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my front door
oh, but, if it don't

will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

oh, if it don't,
stay beautiful
stay beautiful


it's strange to think
the songs we used to sing
the smiles
the flowers
everything is gone

yesterday, i found out about you
even though i'm just looking at you
feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said, "yes"

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby, and you might still have me

you can see that i've been crying
baby, you know all the right things to say
but, do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same?
you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said, "yes"

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby, and you might still have me

oh, i can't resist
before you go
tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this?
no, no, no, no, no

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby, and you might still have me


she said "i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shine
in the sky
the pretty lights
and our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love
and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes
and said "oh, my, my, my"

took me back to the house and the backyard trees
said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did
you never did
took me back when the world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids
you and i
oh, my, my, my

well i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined
like pretty lights
and our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes,
and said "oh, my, my, my"

took me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a.m. running in your truck
and all i need is you next to me
took me back to the time we had our very first fight
you stayed outside
till the morning light
oh, my, my, my

a few years have gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
and you looked at me
got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came
and our mamas cried
you said "i do"
and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on the very front porch
after all this time
you and i

i'll be eighty seven
you'll be eighty nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky
oh, my, my, my


i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around, turn the radio down
he says, "baby, is somethin' wrong?"
i say, "nothing, i was just thinkin'
how we don't have a song"

our song is the slammin' screen doors
sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date "man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have"
and when i got home
for i said, "hey, man!"
askin' god if he
could play it again

i was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway, well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice all the roses

our song is the slammin' screen doors
sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date "man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have"
and when i got home
for i said, "hey, man!"
askin' god if he
could play it again

i've heard every hour and listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song

'cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date "man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have"
and when i got home
for i said, "hey, man!"
askin' god if he
could play it again
play it again

i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song


drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing, everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
that i can't even see anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight, give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see


i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around, turn the radio down
he says, "baby, is somethin' wrong?"
i say, "nothing, i was just thinkin'
how we don't have a song"

our song is the slammin' screen doors
sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date "man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have"
and when i got home
for i said, "hey, man!"
askin' god if he
could play it again

i was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway, well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice all the roses

our song is the slammin' screen doors
sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date "man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have"
and when i got home
for i said, "hey, man!"
askin' god if he
could play it again

i've heard every hour and listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song

'cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date "man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have"
and when i got home
for i said, "hey, man!"
askin' god if he
could play it again
play it again

i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song


in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we don't say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you

just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world
tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
and i don't try to hide my tears
the secrets all my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you

when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself
only you can see

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me, who i wanna be
well, i'm only me when i'm with you
with you


she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
she'll never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by
and you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
but you are everything to me

and i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you
like i want to
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible

there's a fire inside of you
that can't help but shine through
she's never gonna see the light
no matter what you do
and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be

i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you
like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
instead of just invisible

like shadows in a faded light
oh, we're invisible
i just wanna look in your eyes
and make you realise

i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
baby, let me love you
let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible

she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile


why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

maybe i should've seen the signs
should've read the writing on the wall
and realised by the distance in your eyes
that i would be the one to fall

no matter what you say
i still can't believe
that you would walk away

why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

it's not unbroken anymore
how do i get it back the way it was before?

why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?

why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?


hey, a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is taylor swift and have you heard this song yet?

i have heard this song.

tim mcgraw. and what what did you think the first time you heard it? or how was the first time?

it was awesome. uh, except for i didn't know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old.

*laughs*

i didn't know which one but the more, the more i hear it the more... i don't know if it's true or not but i start taking it as a compliment and not that i feel that i'm old. i don't know if that's true but that's what i choose to think.

why don't we find out? taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?

oh it's definitely a compliment. yeah.

*laughs*

tim mcgraw meet taylor swift.

nice-

nice to meet you.

nice to meet you, taylor. how you doing?

i'm doing great. how are you doing?

i'm doing good. congratulations on your record! it's doing great.

thank you so much. i'm just so excited. thank you for uh having good music and everything. i swear i'm not a stalker.

*laughs*

well-

the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer, some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, i wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know i really didn't think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so. i kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. but um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.

*laughs*

well i'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya.

so i-
so i understand that you two guys have not talked?

no.

you haven't met?

no.

no, we've never talked or met or anything.

i sent her a message one time. i think with entertainment weekly or something like that. oh i don't remember what show it was. i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day. so, i sent her a little message. so, i don't know if she got it or not.

oh my god. they never gave that to me.

they didn't? okay well, there ya go. i did.

*laughs*

so i-i

we've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.

not at all.

so i thought, i think it's pretty brave to put out a song called "tim mcgraw" without maybe talking to tim mcgraw. did you mind?

it was definitely kind of a chance. ya know i didn't say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.

well, thank you for that. thank you for not saying anything bad. i'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. tell me-

could you tell faith that i said hello?

i sure will. i sure will. and she loves the song too by the way.

oh my gosh, she's awesome.

i agree.

this, this... tell me about writing a song. um did this, did this really happen?

well, yeah. i mean, i never really kinda went into this writing session on i'm gonna write a song called tim mcgraw. um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. but um...

*laughs*

i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.

now i feel old.

and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up. so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me. and its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs. they just are.

aww, thank you.

and uh, you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out all right. and ya know, the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. and uh, then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well that's your first single"

*laughs*

"and i'm like "well..."

well you can write songs about me anytime, taylor.

*laughs*

that's awesome. there's a part two coming out next month.

all right, great.

*laughs*

well congratulations 'cause it's your first single, first top ten hit and that's pretty exciting and i know you're off to the races here. you're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.

awesome, it's been so exciting. tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?

um i don't know. i don't know. we'll have to look into that.

*laughs*

well i'll, i have someone who i think will be really perfect for it.

ya do? what would-

yeah.

what would their name be?

uh, um i think taylor something.

something like that yeah.

but-

well i'll, i'll be more than happy to have you out with me.

just consider it.

ah, well that's very good. you're pretty fearless taylor swift. i'll tell ya that.

right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.

i think so. country countdown usa is now a booking agency as well.

absolutely.

hey taylor, i know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.

it was awesome and thank you. it was good to meet you tim.

you too. good talking to you. bye bye now.

bye

good luck out there.

thanks


last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears,
i'll give it to someone special

once bitten and twice shy
i keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
tell me baby, do you recognize me?
well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

"merry christmas" - i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying "i love you", i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kissed me now, i know you'd fool me again

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears,
i'll give it to someone special

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears,
i'll give it to someone special

a crowded room, and friends with tired eyes
i'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god, i thought you were someone to rely on
me? i guess i was a shoulder to cry on

a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl under cover but you tore her apart
maybe this year, maybe this year
i'll give it to someone special

cause last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears,
i'll give it to someone special

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears,
i'll give it to someone special

and last christmas
and this year
it won't be anything like, anything like

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears,
i'll give it to someone special


please take down the mistleoe
'cause i don't wanna think about that right now
cause everything i want is miles away
in a snow covered little town
mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
seasons greetings hope you're well
i'm doing all right if you were wondering
lately i can never tell

i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when you were mine

i've been doing fine without you, really
eveybody's here except you, baby

but for me it's just a lonely time
cause there were christmases when you were mine

that'll have to be something i just say this year

bet you got your mom another sweater
were your cousins late again?
when you were putting up the lights this year
did you notice one less pair of hands?

i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases whe i didn't


santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
i've been an awful good girl, santa baby

santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
well i'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby

think of all the fun i've missed
think of all the boys i haven't kissed
next year i could be just as good
if you check off my christmas list

santa baby, i want a yacht and really that's not a lot
i've been an angel all year, santa baby

santa, honey, there's one more thing i really do need, the deed
to a platinum mine, santa honey

come and trim my christmas tree
with some decorations bought at tiffany's
i really do believe in you
let's see if you believe in me

santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
a ring
and i don't mean on the phone, santa baby


all is calm and all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

shepherds quake at the sight
glories stream from heaven afar
heavenly hosts sing halleluia
christ the savior is born
christ our savior is born

son of god
love's pure light
radiant beams from thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace
jesus lord at thy birth
jesus lord at thy birth

halleluia!
halleluia!
halleluia!

christ the savior is born


what if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
what would happen if god never let it snow
what would happen if christmas carols told a lie
tell me what you would find

you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more

what if angels did not pay attention to
all the things that we wish they would always do
what if happiness came in a cardboard box
then i'd think there was somethingwe all forgot
what would happenif presents all went away
tell me what would you find

you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more

we get so caught up in all of it
business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here
it seems the last thing on your mind

you'd say that today holds something special
something holy and not superficial
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something
christmas must be something
christmas must be something more
there's gotta be more


i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
where the tree tops glisten and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow

i'm dreaming of a white christmas
with every christmas card i write
may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white

i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
so may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white

may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white


your beautiful eyes
stare right into my eyes
and sometimes
i don't know why
i want to be somewhere where you are
i want to be where...

you're here, your eyes are looking into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm looking through your
i'm looking through your eyes

i wake up, i'm alive
in only a little while... i cry
'cause you're my lullaby
so baby come hold me tight 'cause i - i
i want to be everything you need
i want to be where...

you're here, your eyes are looking into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm looking through your
i'm looking through your eyes

just as long as you're mine
let me love you, kiss you
oh baby let me miss you
let me see your
dream about
dream about
dream about your eyes
eyes, eyes... beautiful eyes


it's strange to think
the songs we used to sing
the smiles
the flowers
everything is gone

yesterday, i found out about you
even though i'm just looking at you
feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said, "yes"

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby, and you might still have me

you can see that i've been crying
baby, you know all the right things to say
but, do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same?
you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said, "yes"

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby, and you might still have me

oh, i can't resist
before you go
tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this?
no, no, no, no, no

you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby, and you might still have me


drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing, everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
that i can't even see anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight, give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do

he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see


state the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
that's fine, i'll tell mine you're gay
by the way...

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

there's no time for tears
i'm just sitting here planning my revenge
there's nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

and if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard, i really really hate that...

stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

burn, burn, burn, baby burn
you're just another picture to burn
baby, burn...


in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we don't say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you

just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world
tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
and i don't try to hide my tears
the secrets all my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you

when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself
only you can see

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying
to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me, who i wanna be
well, i'm only me when i'm with you
with you


there's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot, yeah

we're drivin' down the road, i wonder if you know
i'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
absent-mindedly makin' me want you

and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless

so baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
in this one horse town, i wanna stay right here
in this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
in this moment, now capture it, remember it

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless

well, you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake, i'm not usually this way
but you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
it's fearless

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless


oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

my daddy says that life comes at you fast
we all like blades of grass
we come to prime and in time we just wither away
and it all changes
my view with a looking glass won't catch the past
only photographs remind us of the passing of days
oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
see i recall being afraid of the dark
and holding on to teddy bears
i'd wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
that was then and now i'm here

so hear me scream
i was too young to understand what it means
i couldn't wait till i could be seventeen
i thought he lied when he said take my time to breathe
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
i'm seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
seventeen
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen

my mother said don't forget where you come from, where you've been
always keep your closest friends they can't slip away
they keep you grounded
oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice
and yeah i guess that sounded nice when i was ten
oh but never were there truer words
and i'll my days i've ever heard
and when she told me little girl the answer is love
so those are words that i keep with me
though the seasons change so quickly
keep them buried in my heart
and never fought

so hear me scream
i was too young to understand what it means
i couldn't wait till i could be seventeen
i thought she lied when she said "take your time to breathe"
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen

see i was racing and waiting for the day that i would be old enough
guess i'll be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough

i was too young to understand what it means
i couldn't wait till i could be seventeen
i thought she lied when she said "take your time to breathe"
now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
i'm seventeen
oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

now i wish i could freeze the time at seventeen



i'm sorry if i seem uninterested
oh i'm not listenin', oh i'm indifferent
truly i ain't got no business here
but since my friends are here, i just came to kick it
but really i would rather be at home all by myself
not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
i don't dance, don't ask, i don't need a boyfriend
so you can, go back, please enjoy your party
i'll be here, somewhere in the corner
under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
and i can hardly hear
over this music i don't listen to
and i don't wanna get with you
so tell my friends that i'll be over here

oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself, what am i doin' here?
oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
and i can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

excuse me if i seem a little unimpressed with this
an antisocial pessimist, but usually i don't mess with this
and i know you mean only the best and your
intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly i'd rather be
somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
and we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
not there in the kitchen
with the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
oh tell them i'll be here
'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
oh god why am i here?

oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself, what am i doin' here?
oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
and i can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
how did it ever come to this? i should've never come to this
so holla at me, i'll be in the car when you're done
i'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
and i'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
so tell my people when they're ready that i'm ready
and i'm standin' by the tv with my beanie low
yo i'll be over here

oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
oh oh oh i asked myself, what am i doin' here?
oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here


run, run like the devil's behinds us
run to where no one can find us
be my accomplice to my crime
oh baby
run, run 'cause we're guilty as sin
run 'cause we know we won't win
we know together we kill time

you'll never face a judge without me
you'll never battle the gavel alone
and if they lock us away
then i'll be still here
proudly waiting to kill more time, with you...

we'll be outlaws
we'll take on the world
we'll be outlaws

run, run like you never did
'cause they found the evidence
and they found your fingerprints
all on me and baby run
run like your life depends on it
let's make forever in this moment
tell me you love me again, oh again
and i would waste away without you
you're the shine into my star
i'd be searching till i found you
wherever you are... you are

we'll be outlaws
partners in crime
we'll take on the world together
i'm bonnie you can be clyde
we'll be outlaws
you and me
they'll never understand the honor
among these thieves

you'll never face a judge without me
you'll never battle the gavel alone
and if they lock us away
then i'll be still here
proudly waiting to kill more time
with you...
oh with you
w-i-t-h you
with you

we'll be outlaws
partners in crime
we'd take on the world together
i'm bonnie you can be clyde
we'll be outlaws
you and me
they'll never understand the honor
among these thieves
we'll be outlaws...


some nerve you have
to break up my lonely
and tell me you want me
how dare you march into my heart
oh how rude of you
to ruin my miserable
and tell me i'm beautiful
'cause i wasn't looking for love no
nobody asked to get me attached to you
in fact you tricked me
and i wasn't trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
so all that i'm asking
is that you handle me with caution
'cause i don't give myself often
but i guess i'll try today

'cause i've had my heart
broken before
and i promised i would never let me hurt anymore
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i'm yours

i'm mad at you
for being so cute
and changing my mood
and altering my rude
what's wrong with you
you make me sick for being so perfect
what did i do
what can i do, oh
and i wasn't trying
to melt this heart of iron
but the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
and i would be lying
if i said i wasn't scared to fall again
but if you promise me you'll catch me
then it's okay

'cause i've had my heart
broken before
and i promised i would never let me hurt anymore
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i'm yours

oh i hate that i
spend my days just wasting time day dreaming till i see you again
i'm not used to this
oh i used to be so used to boys just using me
for you to be you to me
feels new to me
'cause i usually cheer for the bad side
love under a bad sign
so it makes me mad i'm
falling again
falling again

but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i'm yours
oh baby i'm yours


i grew up memorizing all the cracks in the wall
staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
see i prayed every day for a change to be made
and i'd wait to be saved, oh no
shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
see i knew i was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing

i assumed there was only room for
my dreams in my dreams so i'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
and i didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

then the universe aligned
with what i had in mind
who knew there was a life
behind those four pink walls?

now i wake up to a different bedroom everyday
living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
used to sit and watch paint dry
amazed by the limelight
i can't ever be afraid

i assumed there was only room for
my dreams in my dreams so i'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
and i didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

then the universe aligned
oh, with what i had in mind
who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
oh, the universe aligned
with what i wanted all this time
i knew there was a life
behind those four pink walls

all of the days that i wasted gazing outside the window
impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
and i wondered why
things weren't different
went from "when boredom strikes" to "ms. star on the rise"
it was all in an instant man
but those four pink walls, now i kinda miss them man

then the universe aligned
with what i wanted all this time
i knew there was a life
behind those four pink walls


to me, 'where the wild things are' is a place that exists in our minds. it's a place of liberty and shamelessness. it can take a split second of our lifetime to find it, but once you do you'll be free.

find table spaces
say your social graces
bow your head, they're pious here
but you and i, we're pioneers
we make our own rules
our own room, no bias here
let 'em sell what they are sellin'
there are no buyers here
so gather all the rebels now
we'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
we don't care what they say no way, no way
and we will leave the empty chairs
to those who say we can't sit there
we're fine all by ourselves

so aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
no mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
we have no apologies for being...

find me where the wild things are
oh my, we'll be all right
don't mind us
find me where the wild things are
oh my, we'll be just fine
don't mind us, yeah
find me where the wild things are

i lose my balance on these eggshells
you tell me to tread, i'd rather be a wild one instead
don't wanna hang around the in crowd
the cool kids aren't cool to me
they're not cooler than we are

so aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
no mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
we have no apologies for being...

find me where the wild things are
oh my, we'll be all right
don't mind us, yeah
find me where the wild things are
oh my, we'll be just fine
aye-aye-aye don't mind us

we will carve our place into time and space
we will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey
find you're great, don't you hide your face
and let it shine, shine, shine, shine

so aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
no mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
we have no apologies for being...

find me where the wild things are
oh my, we'll be all right
don't mind us, yeah
find me where the wild things are
oh my, we'll be just fine
don't mind us, yeah
find me where the wild things are

there's a wild thing that exists in all of us, it lives in our passions and the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs... it's even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we can't be scared of it... we have to become it.


so much on my mind
i think i think too much
read between these lines
unspoken weight of words
but time comes to rest when you are by my side
it blurs

and i will follow where this takes me
and my tomorrows long to be unknown
when all is shaken be my safety
in a world uncertain say you'll be my stone

change in every wind
the sands of time don't know our name
oh nothing's sure but surely as we stand
i promise i will stay the same
and i've never seen forever
but i know we'll remain

and i will follow where this takes me
and my tomorrows long to be unknown
when all is shaken be my safety
in a world uncertain say you'll be my stone

be my stone
in a world uncertain say you'll be my stone

oh steady me
be my source of gravity
while me world's unraveling
say you'll never change
oh oh

and i will follow where this takes me
and my tomorrows long to be unknown
when all is shaken be my safety
in a world uncertain say you'll be my stone

be my stone
in a world uncertain say you'll be my stone


oh and i overdose
boy i want off this roller coaster
you take me high just to bring me down
oh, and you bring me down, down

i'm trying not to take too much
i'm in over my head
over love, boy i over trust
give me the chance to pick up the pieces you left me in
why did i let you in?
overzealous, i'm over this
oh i'm over us
over and over
i let you under my skin and it's over
i promise never again you'd come over
something takes over me
i can't control this hallucinogen

oh and i overdose
boy i want off this roller coaster
you take me high just to bring me down
oh, and you bring me down

oh and i overdose
boy i want off this roller coaster
you take me high just to bring me down
oh, and you bring me down

we fight, we laugh
detox, rehab
letting go of what we had
oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
over trying
over lies
over crying
over-traumatized
over-worked and moreover i'm done
over and over
i'm falling under your spell, call me over
i'm runnin' back to this hell you come over
and didn't you say we were through?
why can't i get over you?

oh and i overdose
boy i want off this roller coaster
you take me high just to bring me down
oh, and you bring me down

oh and i overdose
boy i want off this roller coaster
you take me high just to bring me down
oh, and you bring me down

boy i come crashing, crashing
down from the high and wondering, wondering
wondering why this ain't over
let it just be over
sobering thoughts taking over my mind

oh and i overdose
boy i want off this roller coaster
you take me high just to bring me down
oh, and you bring me down
oh and i overdose
boy i want off this roller coaster
you take me high just to bring me down
oh, and you bring me down


knock on my door, boy come home
you stay in my head
lay in my arms, why won't you?
it's been way too long
what you waiting on?
'cause i've been laying here
learning what the memories won't do
see i need you and baby i need to
let down my guard and give you my scars
open up my heart

we could be stars...
we could be stars...
we could be stars...

rap on my window, come home
it's been a while, so stick around
why don't you?
till the end of time
say that you'll be mine
an uphill climb fighting what the heart
really wants to do
see i need you
and sometimes we need to
shed our facade and be just who we are
all broken and torn, then we could be stars

oh we could be stars...
we could be stars...
we could be stars...

piercing lights in the dark
make the galaxy ours
kingdom right where we are
shining bright as a morning
you'll never be lonely
just promise you'll love me
i'm never too far
and we'll never part
and we could be stars

oh we could be stars...
we could be stars...
oh we could be stars...

just find way to get home
there's a space in my heart
open arms for you to run to
baby close your eyes and take the leap
to make believe in fairytales
i'll meet you there
oh yeah, i'll fall too
see i've wanted you here
all along but my fear
just keeps haunting me won't let me go
so it's hard to say i love you

we could be stars...
oh we could be stars...
we could be stars...
we could be stars...


she just wants to be beautiful
she goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
she craves attention, she praises an image
she prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
oh, she don't see the light that's shining
deeper than the eyes can find it
maybe we have made her blind
so she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

but there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you're beautiful just the way you are
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

she has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
you know, covergirls eat nothing
she says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"what's a little bit of hunger?"
"i could go a little while longer," she fades away
she don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
so to all the girls that's hurting
let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
the light that shines within

there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you're beautiful just the way you are
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

no better you than the you that you are
no better you than the you that you are
no better life than the life we're living
no better life than the life we're living
no better time for your shine, you're a star
no better time for your shine, you're a star
oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

and there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you're beautiful just the way you are
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
and you don't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

still got the flowers that you sent
and the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever
i keep them all as evidence
in a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises
i don't know why
i keep letting you lie to me
hard as i try
it seems i can't break away
i thought that you would be the hero
come and save the day
but you're a villain
your sins unforgiven

i'm going down, and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
under the waves, i've found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go 'head and wish me well
i'll cry a wishing well
i'll fly before i fail
i'll set sail and drift away
so i won't need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears

i catch your scent in every wind
and i recall the love we had
i can't pretend that i don't miss you
every now and then
but the hurt is for the better
moving on, it's now or never
lost in the tide, i can't keep my pillows dry
like there's a sea in my eyes
i realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
then it builds you coffins
and far too often
we end up falling to our demise

i'm going down, and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
under the waves, i've found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go 'head and wish me well
i'll cry a wishing well
i'll fly before i fail
i'll set sail and drift away
so i won't need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears

cry me a river, build myself a bridge
i'm over this, can't let memories become the death of me
i'm glad to see everything that you are
and i believe that you are everything i needed
but i don't need no more

i'm going down, and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
under the waves, i've found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go 'head and wish me well
i'll cry a wishing well
i'll fly before i fail
i'll set sail and drift away
so i won't need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears


tune in to find my peace and solitude
these empty rooms spin, and i embrace the flaws of being human
the black and white... and sometimes the greys that stay for days
the in between time
the meantime that make this song of life sing
play, rest, repeat, read exactly what is written on the sheet
"don't deviate, " they say
but i will play what's best for me
i'll press the keys and pull the strings
create a symphony that's mine

and i'll spend my life penning my song, my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls don't make history
so i may never be what you assume
don't want your hooks or auto-tune
if i'm off-key then that's alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when i'm gone
my song will carry on

let go
i let my voice be heard, then listen for the echo
my own reverb is playing
'cause i'm a movement
there's dissonance, sometimes i make mistakes
so i'm human after all, i'm not your expectations
but play, rest, repeat, that's what they ask of me
just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
but i'll play what's best for me
i'll ring the bells and crash the cymbals
my harmonious desire

and i'll spend my life penning my song, my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls don't make history
so i may never be what you assume
don't want your hooks or auto-tune
if i'm off-key then that's alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when i'm gone
my song will carry on

in my time here, i wanna be revered and remembered
oh let them say i came, i conquered
so i won't fear and i can't blend in
you can't replace me and you cannot erase me
'cause my song will live on beyond time

and i'll spend my life penning my song, my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls don't make history
so i may never be what you assume
don't want your hooks or auto-tune
if i'm off-key then that's alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when i'm gone
my song will carry on
and i'll spend my life penning my song, my song
and the verses i write will speak for me
good girls don't make history
so i may never be what you assume
don't want your hooks or auto-tune
if i'm off-key then that's alright with me
oh and maybe you will learn this when i'm gone
my song will carry on

"counterfeit, counterfeit" that's what you're shouting at me
i could run but i'd sooner have this
and amicably lick the blood stain from your finger, say "what do you see?"

you get a feeling, that's what you choose
and i was told there was not a minute to lose
so if you're waiting, jump out your skin
to find a cure for whatever state your in
i tell my good friends "get out the way"
of all the lightning hitting the trees today
we get a thrill from clapping our hands
we find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

ooh, i put on my shoes and i'm ready for the weekend
ooh, i put on my shoes and i'm ready for the weekend, yeah
ooh, i put on my shoes and i'm ready for the weekend
ooh, i put on my shoes and i'm ready for the weekend, weekend, weekend, weekend

coming back, coming back, to a place where i never knew
pushing knobs, pushing faders, but i don't know what they do
this reflection in my mirror reminds me of you

i've got to stop waiting for you
and move onto someone new
but everything around me is blue
the colour that reminds me of you

i've got to stop looking back
my head can get lost off track
and i know that you're not comin' back
but lord i wish you would now

i feel like my life's cut short
i feel like my love's shop bought
i'm looking happy, but i'm not, no i'm not, no my baby
i feel like my life's cut short
i feel like my love's shop bought
i'm looking happy, but i'm not, no, no, no-o

when i think there's nothing left to lose
i take a look at what's in front of you
it's upsetting when i'm forced to choose
i'm reminded of the colour blue

can you stay up for the weekend
and blame god for looking too old
can you find all that you stand for
has been replaced with mountains of gold

you cannot dream yourself to notice
to feel pain and swallow fear
but can you stay up for the weekend
for next year

god, i can't do this any more
though i'll be laid down on the floor
as many feet walk through the door

i'm not alone

if i see a light flashing
could this mean that i'm coming home
if i see a man waving
does this mean that i'm not alone

if i see a light flashing
could this mean that i'm coming home
if i see a man waving
does this mean that i'm not alone
no?

if i see a light flashing
could this mean that i'm coming home
if i see a man waving
does this mean that i'm not alone

if i see a light flashing
could this mean that i'm coming home
if i see a man waving
does this mean that i'm not alone


i'm coming round and now my vision is so clear
if i could change my state of mind, then i would disappear
the love i get from you is something i can't chance
and i could let you slip away, without a second glance

why can't i realize i'm fighting for my life?
whoa, whoa!
why can't i realize i'm fighting for my life?
whoa, whoa!

this is like a flashback
this is like a dream

every time i came around
she made her body go down
her physical was so crazy
she could make a blind man see
ooh

before then, we got separated
and i ain't looking for no replacement
no, whoa, whoa, whoa

if i gotta almost search the whole club
trying to get to her before she sobers up
let me see you throw your hands up
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

where did she go? where did she go?
where did she go? where did she go?

where did she go?
where did she go?
where did she go?

i'm looking for the girl
i'm looking for the girl
i'm looking for the girl
that girl, that girl

i must've seen her beauty at the bar
under the strobe lights, looking like a star
but everyone started rushing me
looking through the crowd, shawty left the scene, oh

before then, we got separated
and i ain't looking for no replacement
no, whoa, whoa, whoa

if i gotta almost search the whole club
trying to get to her before she sobers up
let me see you throw your hands up
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

where did she go? where did she go?
where did she go? where did she go?
where did she go? where did she go?

where did she go? where did she go?
where did she go? where did she go?

club closing up, i'm still looking for you
walked up to the ladies room
no luck, so i'm headed to the dj booth

next thing i know
she tell my show, "this ain't you
looking at you, you wanna take me home

i'm looking for the girl, i'm looking for the girl
i'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl
i'm looking for the girl, i'm looking for the girl

damn ...
it's getting hard to breathe
i'm trying to make her see,
that she do not really know
that i'm trying to find a way,
and tell her every day, that she just goes along
so i...
i do not wanna be,
the only one that knows
that somebody could come along and just
take her right from me
i'm standing shaking ground,
and i've been thinking that i'm gonna lose it,

'cause i'm losing my head,
i'm losing my mind,
i'm losing control of myself this time.
she's got me losing my head,
i'm losing my mind,
i'm losing my way,
but i think she feels i'm already lost.

i'm already lost.

i wish that i could see,
what is making you
feel that you should be concerned.
my love is like a gunshot
all it takes is one shot for me to blow it all away.
i do not wanna feel like i'm just wasting time,
it's gotta be with you and no one else.
do you notice me,
i need to know right now
'cause i've been thinking that i'm gonna lose it

'cause i'm losing my head,
i'm losing my mind,
i'm losing control of myself this time.
she's got me losing my head,
i'm losing my mind,
i'm losing my way,
but i think she feels i'm already lost.

maybe i'm trying too hard
but girl you make me nervous,
should you have by now noticed me.
and what will it take it
to a heavenly because your
drawing chains and
driving me insane!

girl, i'm losing my head,
i'm losing my mind,
i'm losing control of myself this time.
she's got me losing my head,
i'm losing my mind,
i'm losing my way,
but i think she feels i'm already lost.

i spent all my money
on a big old fancy car
for these bright eyed honeys
oh yeah, you know who you are

keep me up till the sun is high
till the birds start calling my name
i'm addicted and i don't know why
guess i've always been this way

all these roads steer me wrong

all you young, wild girls
yeah, you young, wild girls
you'll be the death of me, the death of me

all you young, wild girls
yeah, you young, wild girls
i'll always come back to you, come back to you

i get lost under these lights
i get lost in the words i say
start believing my own lies
like everything will be okay

oh, i still dream of a simple life
boy meets girl, makes her his wife
but love don't exist when you live like this
that much i know, yes i know

all these roads steer me wrong

all you young, wild girls
yeah, you young, wild girls
you'll be the death of me, the death of me

all you young, wild girls
yeah, you young, wild girls

don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
making smart with their words again, well, i'm bored
because i'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
never not chasing a million things i want
and i am only as young as the minute is, full of it
getting pumped up on the little bright things i bought

baby, be the class clown
i'll be the beauty queen in tears
we're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
let's go down to the tennis court

pretty soon, i'll be getting on my first plane
i'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
but my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
and my boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne

baby, be the class clown
i'll be the beauty queen in tears
we're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
let's go down to the tennis court

and you can watch from your window

baby, be the class clown
i'll be the beauty queen in tears
we're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
let's go down to the tennis court

let's go down to the tennis court

let's go down to the tennis court


we're never done with killing time
can i kill it with you?
'til the veins run red and blue
we come around here all the time
got a lot to not do
let me kill it with you

you pick me up and take me home again
head out the window again
we're hollow like the bottles that we drain
pulses can drive from here
we might be hollow, but we're brave

i love these roads where the houses don't change
where we can talk like there's something to say
i'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
we move in the tree streets, i'd like it if you stayed

now we're wearing long sleeves
and the heating comes on
we're getting good at this

dreams of clean teeth
i can tell that you're tired
but you keep the car on
while you're waiting out front

you pick me up and take me home again
head out the window again
we're hollow like the bottles that we drain
pulses can drive from here
we might be hollow, but we're brave

i love these roads where the houses don't change
where we can talk like there's something to say
i'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
we move in the tree streets, i'd like it if you stayed

we're never done with killing time
can i kill it with you?
'til the veins run red and blue
we come around here all the time
got a lot to not do
let me kill it with you

i love these roads where the houses don't change
where we can talk like there's something to say
i'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
we move in the tree streets, i'd like it if you stayed

and i like you
and i like you
and i like you


i've never seen a diamond in the flesh
i cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
and i'm not proud of my address
in the torn-up town, no postcode envy

but every song's like
gold teeth, grey goose, tripping in the bathroom
bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams

but everybody's like
cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz

you can call me queen bee
let me live that fantasy

my friends and i, we've cracked the code
we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us knows
that we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

but every song's like
gold teeth, grey goose, tripping in the bathroom
bloodstains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams

but everybody's like
cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz

you can call me queen bee
let me live that fantasy

oh, oh, oh
we're bigger than we ever dreamed
and i'm in love with being queen

oh, oh, oh
life is great without a care
we aren't caught up in your love affair

it don't run in our blood
that kind of luxe just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz

you can call me queen bee
let me live that fantasy


the drink you spilt all over me
'lover's spit' left on repeat
my mum and dad let me stay home
it drives you crazy, getting old

we can talk it so good
we can make it so divine
we can talk it good
how you wish it would be all the time

the drink you spilt all over me
'lover's spit' left on repeat
my mum and dad let me stay home
it drives you crazy, getting old

the drink you spilt all over me
'lover's spit' left on repeat
my mum and dad let me stay home
it drives you crazy, getting old

this dream isn't feeling sweet
and i've never felt more alone
it feels so scary, getting old

we can talk it so good
we can make it so divine
we can talk it good
how you wish it would be all the time

this dream isn't feeling sweet
and i've never felt more alone
it feels so scary, getting old

this dream isn't feeling sweet
and i've never felt more alone
it feels so scary, getting old

i want 'em back, i want 'em back
the minds we had, the minds we had
how all the thoughts, how all the thoughts
moved 'round our heads, moved 'round our heads
i want 'em back, i want 'em back
the minds we had, the minds we had
it's not enough to feel the lack
i want 'em back, i want 'em back, i want 'em

you're the only friend i need
sharing beds like little kids
and laughing 'til our ribs get tough
but that will never be enough

you're the only friend i need
sharing beds like little kids
and laughing 'til our ribs get tough
but that will never be enough



i remember when your head caught flame
it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
well you laughed, baby it's okay
it's buzzcut season anyway

explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

we ride the bus with the knees pulled in
people should see how we're living
shut my eyes to the song that plays
sometimes this has a hot sweet taste

the men up on the news
they try to tell us all that we will lose
but it's so easy in this blue
where everything is good

and i'll never go home again
place the call, feel it start
favourite friend
and nothing's wrong when nothing's true
i live in a hologram with you

where all the things that we do for fun
and i'll breathe, and it goes
play along
make believe it's hyper-real
but i live in a hologram with you

cola with the burnt out taste
i'm the one you tell your fears to
there'll never be enough of us

explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good

and i'll never go home again
place the call, feel it start
favourite friend
and nothing's wrong when nothing's true
i live in a hologram with you

where all the things that we do for fun
and i'll breathe, and it goes
play along
make believe it's hyper-real
but i live in a hologram with you


wait till you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness
and she'll send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out
send the call out, send the call out

call all the ladies out
they're in their finery
a hundred jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth

now bring my boys in
their skin in craters like the moon
the moon we love like a brother
while he glows through the room

dancin' around the lies we tell
dancin' around big eyes as well, ah
even the comatose
they don't dance and tell

we live in cities you'll never see on screen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over getting told
to throw my hands up in the air
so there

so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasn't my fault

and everyone's competing
for a love they won't receive
'cause what this palace wants is release

we live in cities you'll never see on screen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team

i'm kind of over getting told
to throw my hands up in the air
so there

i'm kinda older than i was
when i revelled without a care
so there

we live in cities you'll never see on screen
not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team

we're on each other's team
and you know, we're on each other's team
we're on each other's team
and you know, and you know, and you know


there's a humming in the restless summer air
and we're slipping off the course that we prepared
but in all chaos, there is calculation
dropping glasses just to hear them break

it's clear that someone's gotta go
we mean it, but i promise we're not mean

they lose their minds for us
and now we're in the ring
and we're coming for blood

oh oh, you could try and take us
oh oh, but we're the gladiators
oh oh, everyone a rager
oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours

glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines
oh oh, you could try and take us
oh oh, but victory's contagious

chance is the only game i play with, baby
we let our battles choose us

they lose their minds for us
and now we're in the ring
and we're coming for blood

oh oh, you could try and take us
oh oh, but we're the gladiators
oh oh, everyone a rager
oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours

glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines
oh oh, you could try and take us
oh oh, but victory's contagious

no-one 'round here's good
at keeping their eyes closed
the sun's starting to light up
when we're walking home

tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
we'll always win at this
i don't ever think about death
it's alright if you do, it's fine

we gladiate but i guess
we're really fighting ourselves
roughing up our minds so we're ready
when the kill time comes

wide awake in bed
words in my brain
secretly you love this
do you even wanna go free?

let me in the ring
i'll show you what that big word means

oh oh, you could try and take us
oh oh, but we're the gladiators
oh oh, everyone a rager
oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours

glory and gore go hand in hand
that's why we're making headlines
oh oh, you could try and take us
oh oh, but victory's contagious


today is my birthday and i'm riding high
hair is dripping, hiding that i'm terrified
but this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
everything i say falls right back into everything

i'm not, in the swing of things
but what i really mean is
not in the swing of things yet

riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
i won't be her, tripping over onstage
hey, it's all cool

i still like hotels but i think that'll change
still like hotels and my newfound fame
hey, promise i can stay good

i'm little, but i'm coming for the crown
i'm little, but i'm coming for you
i'm little but i'm coming for the title
held by everyone who's up

all work and no play
never made me lose it
all business, all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play

all work and no play
let me count the bruises
all business, all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play

only bad people live to see
their likeness set in stone
only bad people live to see
their likeness set in stone
what does that make me?

i'm not in the swing of things
but what i really mean is
not in the swing of things yet

now, i'm not in the swing of things
but what i really mean is
not in the swing of things yet

all work and no play
never made me lose it
all business, all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play


we wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
i guess you're lucky that it's dark now
and if i like it, then we'll stay
impress the empress, take a shot now

we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are

up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
to stop this

give the bruises out like gifts
you'll get the picture of your dreams
i won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
fill the dashboard just the same ah, a ah

we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are

up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
to stop this, when we're

up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
to stop this

i'll let you in on something big
i am not a white teeth teen
i tried to join but never did
the way they are, the way they seem
is something else, it's in the blood
their molars blinking like the lights
in the underpass where we all sit
and do nothing and love it


we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are out


that slow burn wait, while it gets dark
bruising the sun
i feel grown up with you in your car
i know it's dumb

we've both got a million bad habits to kick
not sleeping is one
we're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
i'm biting my tongue

when people are talking, people are talking
when people are talking, people are talking

raise a glass, 'cause i'm not done saying it
they all wanna get rough, get away with it
let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
we're all alone, we're alone

all my fake friends and all of their noise
complain about work
they're studying business, i study the floor
maybe the internet raised us
or maybe people are jerks

when people are talking, people are talking

raise a glass, 'cause i'm not done saying it
they all wanna get rough, get away with it
let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
we're all alone, we're alone

all the double-edged people and schemes
they make a mess, then go home and get clean
you're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone
we're all alone, we're all alone

i know we're not everlasting
we're a trainwreck waiting to happen
one day the blood won't flow so gladly
one day we'll all get still
get still

when people are talking, people are talking
when people are talking, people are talking

raise a glass, 'cause i'm not done saying it
they all wanna get rough, get away with it
let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
we're all alone, we're alone

all the double-edged people and schemes
they make a mess, then go home and get clean
you're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone
we're all alone, we're alone

when people are talking, people are talking
when people are talking, people are talking
when people are talking, people are talking
when people are talking, people are talking
let 'em talk


we roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
and your breath's hot and gross, but i kiss you like a lover
like stick to the seats of the cars of mongerito
i forget the mallets from the lessons that i went to

and jamie picks fights but the weekend's short lived
because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
and we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
the ceiling or a roof truck, come out and steal our thunder

now the days are getting colder and the burning of our limbs
doesn't happen quite as bad and the burnings dry skin
deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits
to like the movies that we watch to pretend it wasn't winter

and everywhere we go, i can feel the subtle taste
of the d-talk groan and the locker room where we stayed
and you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning

go all the way, have your fun, have it all
this will take you down
get through the days, do your thing, do it well
this will take you down

go all the way, have your fun, have it all
this will take you down
get through the days, do your thing, do it well
this will take you down

i'll pull the trick if i want to
i'll pull the trick and it comes true
i'm chewing gum and it's killing me
we're getting dead and it's the right way to do it

i see you happy in the front seat
i see you with all of your front teeth
you're allergic but you never said
we're getting dead and it's the right way

go all the way, have your fun, have it all
this will take you down
get through the days, do your thing, do it well
this will take you down

go all the way, have your fun, have it all
this will take you down
get through the days, do your thing, do it well
this will take you down


all my life, i've been fighting a war
i can't talk to you or your friends
it's not only you, my heart jumps around
when i'm alluded to, this will not do

'cause i was raised up to be admired
to be noticed, but when you're withdrawn
it's the closest thing to assault
when all eyes are on you, this will not do

i'm faking glory, lick my lips, toss my hair
and turn the smile on and the story's brand new
but i can take it from here
i'll find my own bravado

it's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back
it's a moon eclipsed, woah
and i can tell you that when the lights come on
i'll be ready for this

it's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms
that happens before your eyes
it's a marathon run or a mountain you scale
without thinking of size

i was frightened of every little thing
that i thought was out to get me down
to trip me up and laugh at me
but i learned not to want the quiet of a room
with no one around to find me out
i want the applause, the approval
the things that make me go

it's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back
it's a moon eclipsed, woah
and i can tell you that when the lights come on
i'll be ready for this

it's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms
that happens before your eyes
it's a marathon run or a mountain you scale
without thinking of size

i was frightened of every little thing
that i thought was out to get me down
to trip me up and laugh at me
but i learned not to want the quiet of a room
with no one around to find me out
i want the applause, the approval
the things that make me go


there's nothing i want but money and time
million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick
there's nothing more cruel than only nine lives
a limit in spite will do the trick trick trick trick

we can leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go

there's nothing as fun as coming untied
and running with the kids in the park park park park
there's nothing that's hurt like letting you go
tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark

we can leave the house, leave the party, let the people know
go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go
it's not about just being out with the right people
'cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw

and now i'm letting you know
and now i'm letting you know
and now i'm letting you know
and now i'm letting you know


i'm in a clique but i want out
it's not the same as when i was punched
in the old days there was enough
the card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood

i was in but i want out
my mother's love is choking me
i'm sick of words that hang above my head
what about the kid? it's time the kid got free

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club

i joined the club and it's all on
there are fights for being my best friend
and the girls get their claws out
there's something about hanging out with the wicked kids

take the pill make it too ill
the other day i forgot my old address
i'm sitting pretty on the throne
there's nothing more i want
except to be alone

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club

your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
so drop your chin and take yourself back home
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again

the only problem that i got with the club
is how you've severed from the people who watched you grow up
when you're a member, go on your great adventure again
they will be waiting at the end

be a part of the love club
everything will glow for you
you'll get punched for the love club
for the love club


it feels better biting down
it feels better biting down
it feels better biting down
it feels better biting down
it feels better biting down
it feels better biting down

skip a hit, don't make a sound
breathed so deep, i thought i'd drown
listen to the beats resound

it feels better biting down

skip a hit, don't make a sound
breathed so deep, i thought i'd drown
listen to the beats resound
it feels better biting down
it feels better biting down

the electronics of your heart
see how fast they fall apart
the electronics of your heart
see how fast they fall apart

skip a hit, don't make a sound


bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

if being wrong's a crime, i'm serving forever
if being strong's your kind, then i need help here with this feather
if being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
at the swingin' party down the line

pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
water all around, i never learned how to swim now

if being wrong's a crime, i'm serving forever
if being strong's your kind, then i need help here with this feather
if being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
at the swingin' party down the line
at the swingin' party down the line

bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

if being wrong's a crime, i'm serving forever
if being strong is what you want, then i need help here with this feather
if being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
at the swingin' party down the line
at the swingin' party down the line


i do my makeup in somebody else's car
we order different drinks at the same bars
i know about what you did and i wanna scream the truth
she thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

those great whites, they have big teeth
hope they bite you
thought you said that you would always be in love
but you're not in love no more
did it frighten you
how we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
on the light up floor

but i hear sounds in my mind
brand new sounds in my mind
but honey i'll be seein' you 'ever i go
but honey i'll be seein' you down every road
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

'cause honey i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, i wish i could get my things and just let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

sometimes i wake up in a different bedroom
i whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

all those rumors, they have big teeth
hope they bite you
thought you said that you would always be in love
but you're not in love no more
did it frighten you
how we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
on the light up floor

but i hear sounds in my mind
brand new sounds in my mind
but honey i'll be seein' you 'ever i go
but honey i'll be seein' you down every road
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

'cause honey i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, honey i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
yes, honey i'll come get my things, but i can't let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
oh, i wish i could get my things and just let go
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it
i'm waiting for it, that green light, i want it

oh god i'm clean out of air in my lungs
it's all gone
played it so nonchalant
it's time we danced with the truth
move along with the truth
we're sleeping through all the days
i'm acting like i don't see every
ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

but my hips have missed your hips
so let's get to know the kicks
will you sway with me?
go astray with me?
ah ha

king and queen of the weekend
ain't a pill that could touch our rush
but what will we do when we're sober?
when you dream with the fever
bet you wish you could touch our rush
but what will we do when we're sober?
these are the games of the weekend
we pretend that we just don't care
but we care
when you dream with the fever
bet you wish you could touch our rush
but what will we do when we're sober?

oh god i'm closing my teeth
around this liquor ware
limelight, lose my mind

when they get dark

but my hips have missed your hips

but what will we do when we're sober?

till daylight, we're jaded
we know that it's over
in the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
and the treason, the fantasies of leaving
but we know that, when it's over
in the morning, you'll be dancing with us
oh, dancing with us, oh, dancing with us
dancing with us, us
but what will we do when we're sober?



a couple rebel top gun pilots
flying with nowhere to be
don't know you super well
but i think that you might be the same as me
behave abnormally

let's let things come out of the woodwork
i'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
yeah, awesome right?
so let's let things come out of the woodwork
i'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
dancing with our shoes off
know i think you're awesome, right?

our rules, our dreams, we're blind
our friends, our drinks, we get inspired

might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see
we'll end up painted on the road
red and chrome
all the broken glass sparkling
i guess we're partying

so let's let things come out of the woodwork
i'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
hands under your t-shirt
know i think you're awesome, right?

our rules, our dreams, we're blind
our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
now you know it's really gonna blow

our rules, our dreams, we're blind
our friends, our drinks, we get inspired

our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
our friends, our drinks, we get inspired


well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
use our eyes, throw our hands overboard

i am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
drink up your movements, still i can't get enough
i overthink your p-punctuation use
not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

a rush at the beginning
i get caught up, just for a minute
but lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
can you hear the violence?
megaphone to my chest
broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it

broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it

our thing progresses
i call and you come through
blow all my friendships
to sit in hell with you
but we're the greatest
they'll hang us in the louvre
down the back, but who cares - still the louvre
nothing wrong with it
supernatural
just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

a rush at the beginning
i get caught up, just for a minute
but lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
can you hear the violence?
megaphone to my chest
broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it

one, two

baby really hurt me
crying in the taxi
he don't wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess i'll go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i haven't screwed up
she's so hard to please
but she's a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands
play at romance, we slow dance
in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone
stroking her cheek

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

the truth is i am a toy
that people enjoy
'til all of the tricks don't work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that it's exciting
every perfect summer's
eating me alive until you're gone
better on my own

they say, "you're a little much for me
you're a liability
you're a little much for me"
so they pull back, make other plans
i understand, i'm a liability
get you wild, make you leave
i'm a little much for
e-a-na-na-na, everyone

they're gonna watch me
disappear into the sun
you're all gonna watch me
disappear into the sun



please could you be tender and i will sit close to you
let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
guess this is the winter
our bodies are young and blue
i'm at jungle city, it's late and this song is for you

'cause i remember the rush, when forever was us
before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
well i guess i should go
yeah i guess i should go

hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god i wish i believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh

i light all the candles
cut flowers for all my rooms
i care for myself the way i used to care about you
these days, we kiss and we keep busy
i call from underwater
why even try to get right?
when you've outgrown a lover
the whole world knows but you
it's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god i wish i believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh

three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me
now i'll fake it every single day 'til i don't need fantasy, 'til i feel you leave
but i still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
i'll start letting go of little things 'til i'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

"what is this tape?"
"this is my favorite tape"

bet you wanna rip my heart out
bet you wanna skip my calls now
well guess what? i like that
'cause i'm gonna mess your life up

you asked if i was feeling it, i'm psycho high
know you won't remember in the morning when
i speak my mind
lights are on and they've gone home, but who am i?
oh, how fast the evening passes, cleaning up
the champagne glasses

we told you this was melodrama
cleaning up the champagne glasses)
our only wish is melodrama
cleaning up the champagne glasses)

and the terror
and the horror
when we wonder why we bother
and the terror and the horror
god, i wonder why we bother
melodrama

all the gun fights
and the lime lights
they'll talk about us, all the lovers
how we kiss and kill each other
they'll talk about us, and discover
how we kissed and killed each other

we told you this was melodrama
you wanted something that we offer


break the news-you're walking out
to be a good man for someone else
sorry i was never good like you
stood on my chest and kept me down
hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
did my best to exist just for you

bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

i am my mother's child, i'll love you till my breathing stops
i'll love you till you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours, i stumbled on a secret power
i'll find a way to be without you, babe

i still feel you, now and then
slow like pseudo-ephedrine
when you see me, will you say i've changed?
i ride the subway, read the signs
i let the seasons change my mind
i love it here since i've stopped needing you


in my head, i play a supercut of us
all the magic we gave off
all the love we had and lost
and in my head
the visions never stop
these ribbons wrap me up
but when i reach for you
there's just a supercut

in your car, the radio up
in your car, the radio up
we keep trying to talk about us
i'm someone you maybe might love
i'll be your quiet afternoon crush
make you crazy over my touch

but it's just a supercut of us

so i fall
into continents and cars
all the stages and the stars
i turn all of it
to just a supercut

because ours are the moments i play in the dark
we were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh


i'm a liability
i'm a liability
much for me
you're a little much for me, no no no no...
whatcha gonna do?

all of the dreams that get harder
all of the things that i offer you
make all of the kids in the choirs sing woo-hoo-hoo

maybe all this is the party
maybe the tears and the highs we breathe, oh no
maybe all this is the party
maybe we just do it violently

but you're not what you thought you were
but you're not what you thought you were
but you're not what you thought you were
but you're not what you thought you were


feel the party to my bones
watch the wasters blow the speakers
spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
i hate the headlines and the weather
i'm 19 and i'm on fire
but when we're dancing i'm alright

are you lost enough?
have another drink, get lost in us
this is how we get notorious, oh
'cause i don't know
if they keep tellin' you where to go
i'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

all of the things we're taking
'cause we are young and we're ashamed
sends us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i can't stand to be alone
let's go to perfect places

meet somebody, take 'em home
let's kiss and then take off our clothes

'cause all of the things we're taking
'cause we are young and we're ashamed
sends us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i can't stand to be alone
let's go to perfect places

trying to find these perfect places
trying to find these perfect places
trying to find these perfect places

i'm not a supermodel, i still eat mcdonald's

well some may say i need to be afraid
of losing everything, because of where i
had my start and where i made my name
well everything's the same in the la la land machine

who said i can't wear my converse with my dress
well baby, that's just me
who said i can't be single and have to go out and mingle
baby, that's not me... no no

tell me do you feel the way i feel,
cause nothing else is real in the la la land appeal

well some may say i need to be afraid
of losing everything, because of where i
had my start and where i made my name
well everything's the same in the la la land machine
well i'm not gonna change in the la la land machine
i will stay the same in the la la land
machine, machine, machine

i won't change anything in my life

that's been on my mind
ever since you left
i've been a mess
i'll say it once
and i'll leave you alone
but i gotta let you know

you're a trainwreck
but i wouldn't love you if you changed

i shook your hand

didn't wanna say i'm sorry
for breaking us apart
i didn't wanna say it was my fault
even though i knew it was

i didn't wanna call you back
'cause i knew that i was wrong
yeah, i knew i was wrong

one in the same
never to change
our love was beautiful
we got it all
destined to fall
our love was tragical
wanted to call
no need to fight
you know i wouldn't lie
we'll leave it on the line

listen baby,

never would've said forever
if we knew it ends so fast
why did you say i love you
if you knew that it wouldn't last?

baby, i just can't hear what you're saying
the line is breaking up
or is that just us?
or is that just us?

one in the same
never to change
our love was beautiful
we got it all
destined to fall
our love was tragical
wanted to call
no need to fight
you know i wouldn't lie
we'll leave it on the line

i try to call again, i get your mailbox
like a letter left unread
apologies are often open ended
but this was better left unsaid

one in the same
never to change
our love was beautiful
we got it all
destined to fall
our love was tragical
wanted to call
no need to fight
you know i wouldn't lie
we'll leave it on the line

we'll leave it on the line
yeah, oh yeah


did you forget
that i was even alive
did you forget
everything we ever had
did you forget
did you forget
about me

ever standing by my side
what we were feeling inside
now i'm left to forget
about us

but somewhere we went wrong
we were once so strong
our love is like a song
you can't forget it

so now i guess
this is where we have to stand
did you regret
ever holding my hand
never again
please don't forget
don't forget

we had it all
we were just about to fall
even more in love
than we were before
i won't forget
i won't forget
about us

but somewhere we went wrong
we were once so strong
our love is like a song
you can't forget it

somewhere we went wrong
we were once so strong
our love is like a song
you can't forget it
at all

and at last
all the pictures have been burned
and all the past
is just a lesson that we've learned
i won't forget
please don't forget us

somewhere we went wrong
our love is like a song
but you won't sing along
you've forgotten
about us

don't forget


you reeled me in with your smile
you made me melt with your voice
now, i've been gone now for a while
just to find that i'm your seventh choice

and i don't wanna pay the cost
but it be best if you get lost,
'cause we know you'll never change

don't say that you need me
and don't play these games with my mind
you better get out of my head,
'cause you're wasting your time
and don't say it's forever
and don't play 'cause you had your shot
you better stop messing around,
'cause you're gonna get caught

you promise me all of your time
i guess i'm not the only one
but see, it's my heart on the line this time
i'm your number one, or gone

and don't play these games with my mind

never had the guts to leave,
now you're making it
you know you're making it
now you're making it
you're making it
much easier for me to see

don't say that your sorry
for breaking every inch of my heart
i should've known from the start
now it's time to get lost

and don't say that you need me
and don't play these games with my mind
you better get out of my head,
'cause you're wasting your time
and don't say it's forever
and don't play 'cause you had you shot
you better stop messing around,
'cause you're gonna get caught

you better stop messing around,
'cause you're gonna get caught


she was given the world
so much that she couldn't see
and she needed someone
to show her who she could be

and she tried to survive
wearing her heart on her sleeve
but i needed you to believe

you had your dreams i had mine
you had your fears, i was fine
showed me what i couldn't find
when two different worlds collide
la da da da da

she was scared of it all
watching from far away
she was given a role
never knew just when to play
and she tried to survive
living her life on her own
always afraid of the thrown
but you've given me strength to find hope

you had your dreams i had mine
you had your fears, i was fine
showed me what i couldn't find
when two different worlds collide

she was scared, unprepared
left in the dark, falling apart
i can survive with you by my side
this is what happens when two worlds collide

you had your dreams i had mine
you had your fears, i was fine
showed me what i couldn't find
when two different worlds collide
la da da da da

you had your dreams, i had mine
you had your fears, i was fine
showed me what i couldn't find
when two different worlds collide
when two different worlds collide

i've been trying to leave here for the longest time
the second that i saw you i just knew i found my ride by

i like it, i like it, i like it
i like it, i like it, i like it

i wanna crash, i wanna fall
i wanna be somewhere in the middle
somewhere in the middle
of something, it's better than nothing
i just need a little, i just need a little
and i don't wanna be nowhere
something's making me go there
somewhere in the middle with you

i like it, i like it, i like it
and i like it, i like it, i like it

losing my direction, that's the way it should be
feeling a connection when you're standing next to me
i wanna be rolling, i just wanna be rolling with you

i wanna crash, i wanna fall
i wanna be somewhere in the middle
somewhere in the middle
of something, it's better than nothing
i just need a little, i just need a little
and i don't wanna be nowhere

you're gonna take me from this crazy
i've been waiting
'cause i just need a little, i just need a little
somewhere in the middle with you

i wanna be somewhere in the middle
somewhere in the middle
of something, it's better than nothing

my state of mind has finally got the best of me

a way that i can get to you
just wanna get to you

the world i see is perfect now
you're all around
with you i can breath

until you're mine
i have to find a way to fill this hole inside
i can't survive without you here by my side
until you're mine
not gonna be even close to complete
i won't rest until you're mine, mine

alone inside i can only hear your voice
ringing through the noise
i can't find my mind, keeps on coming back to you
always back to you

wanting something out of reach, it's killing me
you're all i see, yeah

until you're mine
i have to find a way to fill this hole inside
i can't survive without you here by my side
until you're mine
not gonna be even close to complete
i won't rest until you're mine, mine

my state of mind has finally got the best of me
i need you next to me


i'm losing myself
trying to compete
with everyone else
instead of just being me

don't know where to turn
i've been stuck in this routine
i need to change my ways
instead of always being weak

i don't wanna be afraid
i wanna wake up feeling beautiful today
and know that i'm okay
'cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
you see, i just wanna believe in me

la la la la
la la la la

the mirror can lie
it doesn't show you what's inside
and it, it can tell you you're full of life
it's amazing what you can hide
just by putting on a smile

i don't wanna be afraid
i wanna wake up feeling beautiful today
and know that i'm okay
'cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
you see, i just wanna believe in me

i'm quickly finding out
i'm not about to break down, not today
i guess i always knew
that i had all the strength to make it through

not gonna be afraid
i'm gonna wake up feeling beautiful today
and know that i'm okay
'cause everyone's perfect in unusual ways
you see now, now i believe in me

now i believe in me


what did i do to deserve this?
tell me the truth and don't lie
you're pretty good at that but, no not this time
you walk around like you run the world
running your mouth, and talking about me now,
they think that you're the perfect girl,
they're gonna see everything so get back

it's gonna come back around
you know that this town is just too small and i'm too strong to take this again
you just too adverse but i have got news
you know you're just gonna lose
everything and everyone that means so much to you.


i'm feeling bad for,
you are alone and nobody cares that you are
one look into your eyes,
easy to see what you could be but you're not
i say it's time that you give in,
since it was real, you cannot fulfill, you're over
you feel your heart beat deep down
ignoring the shame of causing this pain,
just get out

it's gonna come back around
you know that this town is just too small and i'm too strong to take this again
you just too adverse but i got news
you know you're just gonna lose
everything and everyone that means so much to you.

you keep hearing everything that people say
and you can't take the pain another day


it's coming back around
i told you this town was just too small

you're just too adverse but you can stop now
'cause it's gonna come back around
and around and around and around and around
yeah yeah


it's gonna come back around
you're just too adverse but i've got news
you know you're just gonna lose
everything and everyone that means so much to you
everything and everyone that means so much to you
everything and everyone that means so much to you.


and i feel, i feel a deep connection,
and i think, that we might be onto something, no
and i know it's something special,
seeing you here, is not coincidental, mh

and i've been fighting, fighting, from the other side,

oh, oh

see, i was trying to be everything you weren't expecting,
all i ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing,
now i'm falling way too fast,
everytime i feel this way
oh, something's changed for the better

and i've been fightin, fighting, from the other side,



i throw all of your stuff away
then i clear you out of my head
i tear you out of my heart
and ignore all your messages

i tell everyone we are through
'cause i'm so much better without you
but it's just another pretty lie
'cause i break down
every time you come around, oh, oh

so how do you get here under my skin?
swore that i'd never let you back in
should have known better
than trying to let you go
'cause here we go, go, go again

hard as i try i know i can't quit
something about you is so addictive
we're falling together
you'd think that by now i know
'cause here we go, go, go again

you never know what you want
and you never say what you mean
but i start to go insane
every time that you look at me

you only hear a half of what i say
and you're always showing up too late
and i know that i should say goodbye
but it's no use
can't be with or without you, oh, oh

so how did you get here under my skin?
swore that i'd never let you back in
should have known better
than trying to let you go
'cause here we go, go, go again

hard as i try i know i can't quit
something about you is so addictive
we're falling together
you think that by now i know
'cause here we go, go, go again
and again, and again, and again

i threw all of your stuff away
and i cleared you out of my head
and i tore you out of my heart
oh, oh, oh, oh

so how did you get here under my skin?
swore that i'd never let you back in
should've known better
than trying to let you go
'cause here we go, go, go again

hard as i try i know i can't quit
something about you is so addictive
we're falling together
you think that by now i know
cause here we go, go
here we go again, here we go again

should have known better
than trying to let you go
'cause here we go, go, go again

again, again, again, again
and again, and again, and again
and again, and again, and again
and again, and again


you speak to me
and in your words i hear a melody
but in the twilight it's so hard to see
what's wrong for me

i can't resist
until you give the truth a little twist
as if you're gonna get away with this
you're not sorry

i can't believe i fell for this

i fell through the hole
down at the bottom of your soul
didn't think you could go so low
look at what you've done
your losing me is what you've won
got me planning to go solo, solo

you sing to me
too bad you couldn't even stay on key
if your life is such a mystery
why don't you just stick to acting?

here we go again
you couldn't even find my number until when
you thought that you could get to my best friend
without a script your game is lacking

i can't believe i fell for this

i fell through the hole
down at the bottom of your soul
didn't think you could go so low
look at what you've done
your losing me
here's what you've won
got me planning to go solo, solo

i'd rather go to a party alone
than have to walk around with you on my arm
now that i'm proud to admit that we're done
good luck trying to find me...

'cause i didn't think you could go so low
look at what you've done
your losing me is what you've won
got me planning to go solo

now we're done
'cause you've got me planning to go solo, solo
solo, solo



summer came it took me by surprise
a california sunshine in my eyes
driving with the top down
we sing along to our favorite songs
nothing could go wrong

laughing as we gazed under the moon
you kissed me and it never felt too soon
hard to believe that anything
could tear us apart
then you break my heart

now i know who you are
you got nothin' on me
i see i should have known it from the start
you can't tell me lies, don't even try
cause this is goodbye
goodbye

caught you from the corner of my eye
you smiled at a girl while passing by
thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
i know what's going on
it didn't take me long

wasn't hard to read between the lines
the necklace in your car that wasn't mine
nothing i would give, do, or say
now i'm on my way
now it's too late

now i know who you are
you got nothin' on me
i see i should of known it from the start
you can't tell me lies, don't even try
cause this is goodbye

to broken promises
time to face your carelessness
don't fool me with apologies
and by crawling on your knees

you got nothin' on me
you got nothin' on me

i know who you are
now i see i should have known it from the start

you can't tell me lies, don't even try
cause this is goodbye

now i know who you are
you got nothin' on me
i see, i should have known it from the start
you can't tell me lies, don't even try
cause this is goodbye
goodbye


i'm standing in the center of the room
i watch the boys follow girls perfume
all is as it should be i assume
except for the distance between me and you

you're standing as a flower on the wall
the room is still but we're about to fall
and all the names that brought us here
simply fade away

who you are is falling over me
who you are is everything i need

i'm hoping
i'm waiting
i'm praying you are the one
i'm hoping
i'm waiting
i'm praying you are the one

i used the line you were supposed to say
and all the names that brought us here
now we have to thank

who you are is falling over me
who you are has got me on my knees

i'm hoping
i'm waiting
i'm praying you are the one

if you are i will wait i will follow
i'm here to stay
as long as we're promised tomorrow
i'll wait
who you are is falling over me
who you are has got me on my knees

i'm hoping
i'm waiting
i'm praying you are the one
i'm hoping
i'm waiting
i'm praying you are the one

you are the one


i hear what you're not saying
it's driving me crazy
it's like we stopped breathing in this room
we're both the last to be leaving
i know what you're thinking
i wish you'd make you move

it's much too quiet in here
i wanna disappear
i'm hearing myself thinking too clear
it's too quiet in here
make it all go away
why can't we break this silence
finally

it's like you know where i'm going
you follow me home but
i never invite you inside
i see what you're not showing
i've got you alone but
the air is so still, it's weird

it's much too quiet in here
i wanna disappear
i'm hearing myself thinking too clear
it's too quiet in here
make it all go away
why can't we break this silence
finally

don't stop, don't stop
just promise you'll kiss me goodbye
what's taking so long?
don't tell me you're not gonna try
the tension's building in my mind
i wanna scream and i know why

it's much too quiet in here
i wanna disappear
i'm hearing myself thinking too clear
it's too quiet in here
make it all go away
why can't we break this silence
finally

make it all go away
it's so quiet in here


before i fall
too fast
kiss me quick
but make it last
so i can see
how badly this will hurt me
when you say goodbye
keep it sweet
keep it slow
let the future pass
and don't let go
i could fall too soon
to this beautiful moonlight

but you're so hypnotizing
you've got me laughing while i sing
you've got me smiling in my sleep
and i can see this unraveling
your love is where i'm falling
but please don't catch me

see this heart
won't settle down
like a child running
scared from a clown
i'm terrified
of what you'd do
my stomach screams
just when i look at you
run far away
so i can breathe
even though you're
far from suffocating me
i can't set my hopes too high
cause every hello ends with a
goodbye

but you're so hypnotizing
you've got me laughing while i sing
you've got me smiling in my sleep
and i can see this unraveling
your love is where i'm falling
but please don't catch me

so now you see
why i'm scared
i can't open up my heart
without a care
but here i go
it's what i feel
and for the first time in my
life i know it's real

but you're so hypnotizing
you've got me laughing while i sing
you've got me smiling in my sleep
and i can see this unraveling
your love is where i'm falling
so please don't catch me
if this is love please don't break me
i'm giving up so
just catch me


now you told me on a sunday that it wasn't gonna work
i tried to cry myself to sleep 'cause it was supposed to hurt
we sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out
i knew what you were thinking before you'd say it aloud

don't say you're sorry 'cause i'm not even breaking
you're not worth the time that this is taking

i knew better than to let you break my heart
the soul you'll never see again won't be showing scars
you still love her, i can see it in your eyes
the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie

every time you lie, every time you lie

i woke up the next morning with a smile on my face
and a long list of gentlemen, happy to take your place
less trashier, much classier than who you proved to be
how long's it gonna take before you see that she's no me?

i knew better than to let you break my heart
the soul you'll never see again won't be showing scars, oh no no
you still love her, i can see it in your eyes
the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie

that's the price you pay for your mistakes, goodbye to dreaming
so don't say you're sorry 'cause i'm not gonna listen

i knew better than to let you break my heart
the soul you'll never see again won't be showing scars, oh no no
you still love her, i can see it in your eyes
the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie

oh, every time you lie
don't say you're sorry every time you lie
don't say you're sorry, oh

the truth is all that i can hear every time you lie


i can't take your hand and lead you to the water
i can't make you feel what you don't feel but you know you wanna
find out how to crack me, log in, try to hack me

underneath the surface
there's so much you need to know
and you might feel like you're drowning
but that's what i need to let go

tell me what you got to break down the walls
you just might need dynamite
tell me what you got to break down the walls
kick senseless my defenses

tell me what you're gonna do
i need you to light the fuse
tell me what you got to break down the walls
you just might need dynamite

got dynamite?

i can't paint this picture just so you can hang it
i can't wait for you to understand if you just don't get it
find out how to crack me, log in, try to hack me

underneath the surface
there's so much you need to know
and you might feel that you're drowning
but that's what i need to let go

tell me what you got to break down the walls
you just might need dynamite
tell me what you got to break down the walls
kick senseless my defenses

tell me what you're gonna do
i need you to light the fuse
tell me what you got to break down the walls
you just might need dynamite

when the walls come crashing down
i hope you're standing right in front of me
where my past lies all around me
'cause all you need to save me is to intervene
and make the walls come crashing down

got, got dynamite?

tell me what you got to break down the walls
you just might need dynamite
tell me what you got to break down the walls
kick senseless my defenses

tell me what you're gonna do
i need you to light the fuse
tell me what you got to break down the walls
you just might need dynamite

got dynamite, got dynamite, got dynamite, got dynamite?


oh, woah, oh

i don't know why, i don't know why i'm so afraid
and i don't know how, i don't know how to fix the pain
we're livin' a lie, livin' a lie this needs to change
we're out of time, we're out of time and it's still the same

we can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
you can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
you said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
but i'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone

i'm hearing the noise, hearing the noise from all around
and i'm on the edge, i'm on the edge of breakin' down
like bonnie and clyde, let's find a ride and ditch this town
to keep it alive, keep it alive, don't make a sound

we can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
you can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
you said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
but i'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone

i never wanna take that final look
i'll turn another page, won't close the book

we can't stop the world but there's so much more that we can do
you can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you
you said nobody has to know, give us time to grow and take it slow
but i'd stop the world if they finally let us be alone, let us be alone

let us be alone, let us be alone


you've got a face for a smile, you know
a shame you waste it
when you're breaking me slowly, but i've
got a world of chances, for you
i've got a world of chances for you
i've got a world of chances
chances that you're burning through

i've got a paper and pen
i go to write a goodbye
and that's when i know i've
got a world of chances, for you
i've got a world of chances for you
i've got a world of chances
chances that you're burning through

oh, i'm going my own way
my faith has lost its strength again
and oh, it's been too hard to say
we're falling off the edge again

we're at an end
we're at an end

maybe you'll call me someday
hear, the operator say the numbers no good
and that she had
a world of chances, for you
she had a world of chances, for you
she had a world of chances
chances you were burning through
chances you were burning through
chances you were burning through
oh

you've got a face for a smile, you know


i feel a separation coming on
'cause i know you want to be moving on
you pull me in, avoid a fight
'cause i feel a separation coming on

just prove that there is nothing left to try
'cause the truth that rather we just both deny
you kiss me with those open eyes
it says so much, it's no surprise to you
but i've got something left to say

don't surrender, surrender, surrender
please remember, remember december
we were so in love back then, now you're listening
to what they say, don't go that way
remember, remember december, please remember
don't surrender

you said you wouldn't let them change your mind
'cause when we're together fire melts the ice
our hearts are both on overdrive
don't let these memories get left behind

don't surrender, surrender, surrender
please remember, remember december
we were so in love back then, now you're listening
to what they say, don't go that way
remember, remember december, please remember

i remember us together
with a promise of forever
we could do this, fight the pressure
please remember december

don't surrender, surrender, surrender
please remember, remember december
we were so in love back then, now you're listening
to what they say, don't go that way
remember, remember december, please remember
don't surrender


i've been bruised and i've been broken
can't believe that i put up with all this pain
i've been used and i was choking
on the promise, i would never fall again, mm

i used to sing to your twisted symphony
the weights that had me trapped inside your misery
but now i know the reason why i couldn't breathe

'cause all i want is everything you're not
so go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
and no i don't, don't care what you say
'cause all i really, all i really want is everything you're not

never gonna break my heart again
never gonna see your face again
never wanna feel this way again

your darkness was my weakness
but it turns out that it only went so deep, deep
a meaningless diversion
that is all that you ever meant to me, me, me, me

and i am done with your twisted symphony
the words that had me sound like stolen poetry
i tore the pages and i can finally breathe

'cause all i want i everything you're not
so go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
and no i don't, don't care what you say
'cause all i really, all i really want is everything you're not

never gonna break my heart again
never gonna see your face again

i want a gentleman who treats me like a queen
i need respect, i need love, nothing in between
i will not spell it out for you if you can't see
'cause you're not worth it, you don't deserve me
and now i'm gone...

everything you're not, not, not
everything you're not, not, not

1, 2, 3!

'cause all i want is everything you're not
so go ahead and slam the door 'cause you can't shut me out
and no i don't, don't care what you say
all i really, all i really want is everything you're not

never gonna break my heart again
never gonna see your face again
never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh

never gonna break my heart again
never gonna see your face again
never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh

never gonna break my heart again
never gonna see your face again
never wanna feel this way again, oh oh oh


sometimes you think you'll be find by yourself
cause a dream is a wish you make all alone
it's easy to feel like you don't need help
but it's harder to walk on your own

you'll change inside
when you, realize
the world comes to life
and everything's all right
from beginning to end
when you have a friend
by your side
that helps you to find
the beauty of all
when you'll open your heart and
believe in
the gift of a friend
the gift of a friend

someone who knows when your lost and your scared
there through the highs and the lows
someone you can count on, someone who cares
besides you where ever you go

you'll change inside
when you, realize
the world comes to life
and everything's all right
from beginning to end
when you have a friend
by your side
that helps you to find
the beauty of all
when you'll open your heart and
believe in
the gift of a friend

and when the hope crashes down
shattering to the ground
you, you'll feel all alone
when you don't know which way to go
and there's no such leading you on
you're not alone

the world comes to life
and everything's all right
from beginning to end
when you have a friend
by your side
that helps you to find
the beauty of all
when you'll open your heart and
believe in
when you believe in
you can believe in, the gift from a friend

seems it's my destiny
for love to cause me misery

and oh, i've been down this road before
where the passion it turns into pain
and each time i saw love walk out the door
i swore i'd never get caught up again

and sometimes we get too smart too late
one more heartache for me

i'm an opportunity and i knock so softly
sometimes i get loud when i wish everybody'd just
get off me
so many players you'd think i was a ball game
its every man for themselves, there are no
team mates
this life gets lonely when everybody wants
something
they'll smile up in your face
but they'll get theirs eventually
and i hope i'm there

surrounded by familiar faces without names
none of them know me or want to share my pain
and they only wish to bask in my light, then fade
away
to win my love, to them a game
to watch me live my life in vain
when all is done and the glitter fades, fades
away
they'll get theirs eventually
and i hope i'm there

i drank your poison 'cause you told me its wine
shame on you if you fooled me once
shame on me if you fooled me twice
i didn't know the price
you'll get yours eventually

so what good am i to you if i can't be broken?
you'll get yours, yes you'll get yours
eventually


i can remember
the very first time i cried
how i wiped my eyes
and buried the pain inside
all of my memories
good and bad that's passed
didn't even take the time to realize

staring at the cracks in the walls
'cause i'm waiting for it all
to come to an end
still i curl up right under the bed
'cause it's takin' over my head
all over again

do you even know who you are?
i guess i'm trying to find
a borrowed dream or a superstar?
i want to be a star
is life good to you, or is it bad?
i can't tell anymore
do you even know what you have?

lying awake
watching the sunlight
how the birds will sing
as i count the rings around my eyes
constantly pushing
the world i know aside
i don't even feel the pain
i don't even want to try

i'm looking for a way to become
the person that i dreamt up
when i was 16
oh, nothing is ever enough
ooh, baby it ain't enough
for what it may seem

do you even know who you are?
i'm still trying to find
a borrowed dream or a superstar?
everybody wants to be...
is life good to you, or is it bad?
i can't tell anymore
do you even know what you have?
no

sorry girl
tell a tale for me
'cause i'm wondering
how you really feel
i'm a lonely girl
i'll tell a tale for you
'cause i'm just trying to make
all my dreams come true

do you even know who you are?
oh yeah, yeah
a borrowed dream or a superstar?
oh, i wanted to be a star
is life good to you, or is it bad?
i can't tell, i can't tell anymore
do you even know what you have?
i guess not, oh, i guess not

oh, i'm trying to find
a rising dream, or a falling star?

and watched you have your way with me
i might have cried
but the tears were silent inside, you see

you called me names
made me feel like i was dumb
i didn't feel a thing
and now i'm gone, gone, gone

like a battered child
i got used to your pain but you know it's 'cause

i was weak before now you've made me
so numb i can't feel much for you anymore
i gave you my all my baby

i've been depending on the overgrown
too many lovers that i'll never know
counting my losses as i let them go
heavy the water as i sink below

down down deep down
down deep down
down down deep down

oh won't you be my livewire?
make me feel like i'm set on fire
your love will take me higher and higher
oh won't you be my livewire?

i've been pretending all my shots are blown
cover my heart up never let it show
i'm shaking it off to find a higher low
so heavy the water
oh so heavy the water falling

down down deep down
down deep down
down down deep down

can you hear me falling

down down deep down
down deep down
down down deep down

oh won't you be my livewire?
make me feel like i'm set on fire
your love will take me higher and higher
oh won't you be my livewire?

so hold me when i fall away from the lines
when i'm losing it all, when i'm wasting the light
and hold me when i put my heart in your hands
when i'm losing it all, when i'm wasting it all

oh won't you be my livewire?
make me feel like i'm set on fire
your love will take me higher and higher
oh won't you be my livewire?


before you came 'round, my heart would never beat much faster
before you came 'round, i was ready to slow down
before you came 'round, i was heading for a small disaster
before you came 'round, i was ready to blow me down

let it go, paint my body gold
take our bodies higher and higher and higher
we can go, until the morning glow
we can go higher and higher and higher

before i was found, i felt like i could drain the ocean
before i was found, i didn't want to breathe out
now my soul beats a sound, loud enough to quiet the thunder
a love with no doubt, and now i'm never gonna slow down
never gonna slow down

let it go, paint my body gold
take our bodies higher and higher and higher
we can go, until the morning glow
we can go higher and higher and higher
let it go, paint my body gold
we can go, until the morning glow
we can go higher and higher and higher

walk with our feet on the ground
and we will talk with our head in the clouds
and we will walk with our feet on the ground
and we will talk with our head in the clouds
and we will walk with our feet on the ground
and we will talk with our head in the clouds
and we will walk with our feet on the ground
on the ground, on the ground, on the ground

let it go, paint my body gold
take our bodies higher and higher and higher
we can go, until the morning glow
we can go higher and higher and higher
let it go, paint my body gold
we can go, until the morning glow
we can go higher and higher and higher

let it go, paint my body gold
take our bodies higher and higher and higher
we can go, until the morning glow
we can go higher and higher and higher


lay down your slow
come settle down, settle down
let loose your glow
come settle down, settle down

and i feel life for the very first time
love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
i feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
you carry my fears as the heavens set fire

jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
in a technicolour beat, you and me
caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

beat, beat, beat

warm, unalone
come settle down, settle down
swing me your bones
come settle down, settle down

and i feel life for the very first time
love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
i feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
you carry my fears as the heavens set fire

jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
in a technicolour beat, you and me
caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

give me one drop, i can feel you
make me lose control
we'll be walking, on the water
when we're moving in a technicolour beat
moving in a technicolour beat

caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
in a technicolour beat, you and me
caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat

beat, beat, beat


sat back with the window down
eighty an hour and the radio loud
the same songs with the same old rhymes
tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights

but i can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
you sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
and i promised i'd be there, but you don't make it easy
darling, please believe me

cause loving you, loving you is too hard
all i do, all i do is not enough
loving you, loving you
i cannot be loving you, loving you

loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
all i do, all i do is get burned
loving you, loving you
i cannot be loving you, loving you

count stacks of the routine lies
funny how easy you could see my blindside
still the same songs with the same old beats
sure, i could stay, but there's a place i'd rather be

and i can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
you sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
and i promised i'd be there, but you don't make it easy
darling, please believe me

cause loving you, loving you is too hard
all i do, all i do is not enough
loving you, loving you
i cannot be loving you, loving you

loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
all i do, all i do is get burned
loving you, loving you
i cannot be loving you, loving you

see, i remember all the times you made me covered in crazy
i can't forget about the way you played me
like i was never gonna change your world
it ended long ago, so please just let me go
it ended long ago, so please just let me go

loving you, loving you is too hard
all i do, all i do is not enough
loving you, loving you
i cannot be loving you, loving you

loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
all i do, all i do is get burned
loving you, loving you
i cannot be loving you, loving you

loving you, loving you
all i do, all i do
loving you, loving you
loving you, loving you


downtown we let it go
sunset high and our bodies low
blood rush in the hazy glow
my hands, your bones

loose up we break the scene
one step deep as you fall to me
heart clap, we skip a beat
count one, two, three

and don't you stop the music
get into it
won't you dance with me?

find a space and lose it
you can do it
won't you dance with me?

move your feet and feel it in the space between
you gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
we gotta lose it
we gotta lose it

lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it
lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it

your name i'll never know
as we get down in the world below
caught up in an overflow
my hands, your bones

wide eyed, you look at me
set on fire in a silver dream
spin round you can feel the breeze
count one, two, three

and don't you stop the music
get into it
won't you dance with me?

find a space and lose it
you can do it
won't you dance with me?

lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it
lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it

make a spark, break the dark
find a light with me
who we are from the start
won't you dance with me?

make a spark, break the dark
find a light with me
who we are chasing stars
won't you dance with me?
won't you dance with me?

and don't you stop the music
get into it
won't you dance with me?

find a space and lose it
you can do it
won't you dance with me?

lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it
lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it

lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it
lose it, lose it, lose it
we gotta lose it

move your feet and feel it in the space between
you gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
we gotta lose it
we gotta lose it


i know it hurts sometimes but
you'll get over it
you'll find another life to live
i know you'll get over it

i know you're sad and tired
you've got nothing left to give
but you'll find another life to live
i know you'll get over it


so when you're caught in a landslide
i'll be there for you, i'll be there for you
and in the rain, give you sunshine
i'll be there for you, i'll be there for you

and every time that you're lonely
every time that you're feeling low, you should know
i'll be there for you, i'll be there for you
i'll be there for you, you know

i know your hope is heavy but
you'll get over it
you'll find another life to live
i know you'll get over it

and i know you feel like everything
is falling to the wind
but don't you let the thunder in
'cause i know you'll get over it

so when you're caught in a landslide
i'll be there for you, i'll be there for you
and in the rain, give you sunshine
i'll be there for you, i'll be there for you

and every time that you're lonely
every time that you're feeling low, you should know
i'll be there for you, i'll be there for you
i'll be there for you, you know

you fell down by the wayside
love locked in an overflow
and you threw stones at the starlight
'cause i stood on the sidelines telling you

that i get that you're lonely
and i see that you feel alone
but i heard in a heartbeat
i'll be there for you, you know

so when you're caught in a landslide
i'll be there for you, i'll be there for you

i'm ready to go, i'm ready to go
can't do it alone, can't do it alone
i'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
can't do it alone, can't do it alone
i'm ready to fall, so tired of it all
down deep in a hole, can't do it alone
i'm ready to climb this mountain inside
impossible heights

said you'd always be my white blood
circulate the right love
giving me your white blood
i need you right here with me
said you'd always be my white blood
elevate my soul above
giving me your white blood
i need you right here with me

i'm ready to go, i'm ready to go
can't do it alone, can't do it alone
i'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
can't do it alone, can't do it alone
i'm ready to hope, swing me out of the low
wide awake in the glow, can't do it alone
i'm ready to fly, uncover the light
impossible heights

said you'd always be my white blood
circulate the right love
giving me your white blood
i need you right here with me
said you'd always be my white blood
elevate my soul above
giving me your white blood
i need you right here with me


step out into the sun
skies above they radiate me
lift up, carry the love
do you know?

that i've been out of my mind
this slow life i'm waiting for you
to swing me all of your line
do you know?

since i've been walking solo
dreaming you were back home
i find getting down low
hide until tomorrow

come back into the good life
lose these hazy love lies
i've been chasing my mind

'cause i'm kicking up stones without you
can't pick up the phone without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you

and i'm digging down holes without you
can't be on my own without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you

step out into the dark
where were you when i was trying
to lift up, carry the love
do you know?

that i've been closing my eyes
love me slow, hallucinating
swinging me all of your light
do you know?

since i've been walking solo
dreaming you were back home
i find getting down low
hide until tomorrow

come back into the good life
lose these hazy love lies
i've been chasing my mind

'cause i'm kicking up stones without you
can't pick up the phone without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you

and i'm digging down holes without you
can't be on my own without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you

hold me close when it's over
life goes slow loving sober
feel my bones getting older
sadness grows when you're cold

'cause i am one step heavy and two steps high
hold it steady with you by my side
one step heavy and two steps high
two steps high

'cause i'm kicking up stones without you
can't pick up the phone without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you

and i'm digging down holes without you
can't be on my own without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you

without you
without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you

and i'm digging down holes without you
can't be on my own without you
i'm a little bit lost without you
without you


ever since the rain i've been waking on my own
left an empty space in a home we built to grow
i guess i lost the light, now i've given all my love to you

i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my, given all my love to you, you

ever since the rain i've been living days too slow
lie around and wait for a heart i used to know
they say that over time there'll be nothing left to lose
but i still can't find the light, i've given all my love to you

i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my, given all my love to you, you

i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my, given all my love to you, you

oh i know your body's next to mine
in the dark i can feel it
don't you tell me i'm dreaming
won't you stay with me?
won't you stay with me? oh-oh
won't you stay with me?
won't you stay with me?
won't you stay?

i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my, given all my love to you, you

i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my love to you
i've given all my, given all my love to you, you


throwing fire, trying to make it right
you're getting higher than the ceiling lights
and falling hard enough to lose the fight

not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
living in the moment, paying for the kill
golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
always ends up like this, always gonna lose

dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
you'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
you'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

there's a human in your heart of hearts
hiding true colours made you fall apart
in the mirror you're a work of art
but this is real life, real life

not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
living in the moment, paying for the kill
golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
always ends up like this, always gonna lose

dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
you'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
you'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

give me neon lights, roll me paper heights
i can feel the dice, cooling me
see the plastic life through my bloodshot eyes
i am wild alive, i am wild alive

not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
living in the moment, paying for the kill
golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
always ends up like this, always gonna lose

dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
you'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
you'll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money


all we do is hide away
all we do is, all we do is hide away
all we do is chase the day
all we do is, all we do is chase the day

all we do is lie and wait
all we do is, all we do is lie and wait
all we do is feel the fade
all we do is, all we do is feel the fade

i've been upside down
i don't wanna be the right way round
can't find paradise on the ground
i've been upside down

all we do is hide away
all we do is, all we do is hide away
all we do is chase the day

we're all animals out in the dark
got a feeling that we're all believing in
not waiting for daylight to start

ooh ooh, ooh ooh

not waiting for daylight to start

standing on the world outside
caught up in a love landslide
stuck still, colour blind
hoping for a black and white

are you gonna be my love?
are you gonna be mine?
i feel it falling from the skies above
are you gonna be mine?
my wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
the blue tide pulling me under
or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

walking on the clouds unknown
drop down oh i will never go, never go, never go
floating like gravity has grown
reach down to a deep deep hole, deep hole, deep deep hole

are you gonna be my love?
are you gonna be mine?
i feel it falling from the skies above
are you gonna be mine?
my wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
the blue tide pulling me under
or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

standing on the world outside
i'm a shark in a love landslide


they're building towers that are high enough to see the clouds
yet it don't bother me
the elevators working overtime up and down
yet it don't bother me

'cause i need something more than everything
a higher self deep within
'cause i need something more than everything
a higher self, a higher self

and i know we need a little heart hope
i know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope

they're building aeroplanes faster than the speed of light
yet it don't bother me
the endless cities multiplying out oceansize
yet it don't bother me

'cause i need something more than everything
a higher self deep within
'cause i need something more than everything
a higher self, a higher self

and i know we need a little heart hope
i know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
'cause there is something more than everything
so feel the love and let it in
'cause i know we need a little heart hope

and i know we need a little heart hope
i know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
'cause there is something more than everything
so feel the love and let it in
'cause i know we need a little heart hope


made a home in a basement
didn't think that i'd need the light
'cause all these plans i've been making
get me out of here in time

but it's always two steps backwards
too much gravity to feel the highs
and all these plans i've been chasing
getting caught up and wasted

i don't know where the money goes
i get broke as the city glows
shines bright as i sink down low
down low

but i've got plans to get to you
you know, don't you know
gonna build a paper plane to float to you
you know, don't you know

we'll be scraping the skies without fingertips
screaming "this is the life, we were born for this"
see i've got plans to get to you
you know, don't you know
don't you know
don't you know
don't you know

i've got a hope in the headlights
stood still but i'm feeling fine
'cause all these plans i've been making
will get me out of here in time

but it's always two steps backwards
too much gravity to feel the highs
and all these plans i've been chasing
getting caught up and wasted

i don't know where the money goes
i get broke as the city glows
shines bright as i sink down low
down low

but i've got plans to get to you
you know, don't you know
gonna build a paper plane to float to you

a room filled up with faces and the air so thick i taste it
locking lips like they all wasted, tangled hips like it's a spaceship
heavy heads are racing down the hallways to the basement
where the darkness fills the space and they can feel themselves erasing
can you feel yourself erasing?
they're bursting at the corners as the ceiling's getting shorter
and i'm stuck between a talker and a vhs recorder
the heat seeps through the border as our ice melts down to water
can you feel it getting smaller?

i need to be solo
freedom in the mono
find a space and let go
i need to be solo, solo
now i'm breathing in and i'm breathing out
breathing in and i'm breathing out
i'm breathing in and i'm breathing out
breathing in and i'm breathing out

their mouths are dripping dryer as their souls are slipping higher
it's like treading on a wire laced with kerosene and fire
limbs entangled in kaleidoscopes of prima donna choirs
ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh

i need to be solo
freedom in the mono
find a space and let go
i need to be solo, solo
now i'm breathing in and i'm breathing out
breathing in and i'm breathing out
i'm breathing in and i'm breathing out
breathing in and i'm breathing out

i need to be solo
breathing in and i'm breathing out
freedom in the lie low
breathing in and i'm breathing out
find a space and let go
breathing in and i'm breathing out
i need to be solo, solo
breathing in and i'm breathing out
i need to be solo
breathing in and i'm breathing out
freedom in the lie low
breathing in and i'm breathing out
find a space and let go
breathing in and i'm breathing out
i need to be solo, solo
breathing in and i'm breathing out


lovesick the beat inside my head
waves struck a sea of bitterness
lights out solo in the blue
before i found you

days passed slowly, lost and low
you gave me hope and now there's only

blood running in my veins
i've never been here before
and i got love falling like the rain
i never could've asked for more
i got so much soul inside my bones
take a look at me now
i'm young forever in the sun
i'm living ultralife

turn down the voice inside my head
'cause heaven only knows why we feel this emptiness
but i will climb out, find another view
now i've found you

days passed slowly, lost and low
you gave me hope and now there's only

blood running in my veins
i've never been here before
and i got love falling like the rain
i never could've asked for more
i got so much soul inside my bones
take a look at me now
i'm young forever in the sun
ever since you came i'm living ultralife
ultralife with me, ultralife with me
ultralife with me, ultralife with me

found me on a basement floor
back when i had lost it all
told me what the fight was for
and i'm not giving up no more
you elevate the life in me
illuminate the in-between
forever gonna feel this free
and i'm not giving up now

lovesick the beat inside my head
waves struck a sea of bitterness
lights out solo in the blue
but now i've found you

blood running in my veins
i've never been here before
and i got love falling like the rain
i never could've asked for more
i got so much soul inside my bones
take a look at me now
i'm young forever in the sun
ever since you came i'm living ultralife
i'm living ultralife
oh, we're living ultralife
we're living ultralife
i'm living ultralife


i'm getting high, getting high
getting high on humans
sitting in the backseat, dead heat summer
staring at the ground in a lucid light
i can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
running round my head in a holy fire
open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
freshen up the air underneath the streets
now i'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
don't run, don't hide

and i can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
we're making waves of conversation
got a rush of energy

'cause i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans
i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans

elevate the headstrong dead long halo
caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
i can make your day glow sun to rainbow
colour in your step, let me lose your mind
animate the air with a stone cold question
do you have the time? do you hate your life?
now i'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
don't run, don't hide

and i can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
we're making waves of conversation
got a rush of energy

'cause i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans
i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans
every time i meet your eyes, i can feel life come alive
and i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans

we ride up, we slide up
we won't stop, we won't stop
we ride up, we slide up
we won't stop, no, we won't stop
we ride up, we slide up
we won't stop lighting our minds up
we ride up, we slide up
we won't stop lighting our minds up

'cause i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans
i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans
every time i meet your eyes, i can feel life come alive
and i'm getting high, getting high
i'm getting high on humans

'cause i'm getting, getting high on humans


you walk around the town like you born in a golden crown
you're speaking with the angels loud but no one understands ya
you got the sharpest bite as any killer sharker might
and you control the water like the desert doesn't matter

you're so full of it
and we're so sick of it
you're so full of it
and we're so sick of it

'cause it's all about you
it's all about you
it's all about you
it's all about you

you say it's not enough, you're sipping from a silver cup
but is that how she brought you up to blame the hand that feeds ya?
you only seek to undermine, you only seek to never die

you're so full of it
and we're so sick of it
you're so full of it
and we're so sick of it

'cause it's all about you
it's all about you
it's all about you
it's all about you

and every time you get stars in your eyes
and the planets align in the centre
pushing on out 'til the walls are all wide
and you're out of your mind in the centre
we see your cover, we see another
fooling yourself in the mirror
where is your heart? where is the truth?

when it's all about you
it's not about you
it's not about you
it's not about you

you're so full of it
and we're so sick of it
you so full of it
and we so sick of it all

'cause it's all about you
it's all about you
it's all about you
it's not about you


i could be the only, i could be the only one

you got that throne
baby you got that throne
that golden majestic glow
delight, delight, delight, delight
and i got that hope
ready electric go go
super volcano flow
delight, delight, delight, delight

and i could hold you endlessly
ultralife just you and me
oh my heart is aching
feel my body breaking
there's magic in the way you move
stop the world it's only you
oh my heart is waking
'cause i could be your one and only


i could be the only, i could be the only one

you got that way
baby you got the way with
flying me outer space
delight, delight, delight, delight
and i got that taste
that animalistic chase
delight, delight, delight, delight

and i could hold you endlessly
ultralife just you and me
oh my heart is aching
feel my body breaking
there's magic in the way you move
stop the world it's only you
oh my heart is waking
'cause i could be your one and only


i could be the only, i could be the only one

i could be the only, i could be the only one
i could be the only, i could be the only one
i could be the only, i could be the only one
i could be the only, i could be the only one


heading west to where the sun sleeps
city fallout let our lungs breathe
can you hold me, i can't even speak
oh my, here it goes

and so the echoes slip in slowly
the edges of you keep me holy
can i hold you, i can't even speak
oh my, here it goes

we found love on an empty page
kill the stars above trying to fight the fade
and now my heart skips heavy underneath the waves
we are done, we are gone

'cause this is already bigger
this is already bigger than love
this is already bigger
this is already bigger than us
it's bigger than you
it's bigger than me
it's bigger than you
it's bigger than me
it's bigger than love

hands are shaking at the last call
in the silence can you hear me scream
oh my, here it goes

we found love on an empty page
kill the stars above trying to fight the fade
and now my heart skips heavy underneath the waves
we are done, we are gone

'cause this is already bigger
this is already bigger than love
this is already bigger
this is already bigger than us
it's bigger than you
it's bigger than me
it's bigger than you
it's bigger than me
it's bigger than love

so i'll hold steady like a tiger in the dark
all my days are ready to be hopeless at the stars
'cause this is already bigger than love
oh it's bigger than us

yeah, this is already bigger
this is already bigger than love
this is already bigger
this is already bigger than us
it's bigger than you
it's bigger than me
it's bigger than you
it's bigger than me
it's bigger than love


like two satellites in separate orbit
like a quiet life that's slowly distorted
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough
like two chemicals erupting in thunder
up high in vertigo, you left me to wonder
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough

'cause you were the best thing for me
stole my mind and found my dreams
baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
heart strings, heart strings
best thing for me
open the doors and set me free
baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
heart strings, heart strings

like two radios, our frequency fading
why can't we start again without tessellating
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough
like the afterglow, your words were a million
cut short, now heaven knows a love without feeling
i was so lonely in love
i guess i was never enough

'cause you were the best thing for me
stole my mind and found my dreams
baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
heart strings, heart strings
best thing for me
open the doors and set me free
baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
heart strings, heart strings

stop pulling my heart strings, my heart strings
you got a grip on my heart strings and i don't wanna take it no more
stop pulling my heart strings, my heart strings
you got a grip on my heart strings and i don't wanna take it no more

'cause you were the best thing for me
stole my mind and found my dreams
baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
heart strings, heart strings
best thing for me
open the doors and set me free
baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
heart strings, heart strings

baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
heart strings, heart strings


i sleep away all the light
i keep away, out of sight, out of sight
i slip away and lose my mind, lose my mind
oh my, my, my
oh, how i tried

and as we lie silently
your body soft, so close to me, close to me
i creep away and let you sleep
i dream today, tomorrow speaks
oh my, my, my
oh, how i tried

and as the sun comes out to play
so soon i wish the day away, day away
still left unsaid, the things to say
i lost my heart to window panes
oh my, my, my
oh, how i tried
oh my, my, my
oh, how i tried

oh my, my, my
oh my, my, my
oh my, my, my
oh, how i tried

hanging on a silver string
all the love that we could've been
summer fading out the spring
feel the warmth underneath your wings
and i will never let you go
all the words you want to scream
take my heart slowly out of me
forever falling in a dream
all the love that we could've been

i never get high when you're feeling low
i'm pulling down stars just to make you glow
it's just the way you are when you're overgrown
i'm chasing down light in the indigo
it's just the way you are when you're overgrown
and i will never let you go
and i will never let you go

promise i will never run
catching fire, let the light become
shallow edges of the sun
feel the heat, hold it in your lungs
never could've loved you more
by your side in a quiet roar
this is what my hope is for
watch you float when the water's gone

i never get high when you're feeling low
i'm pulling down stars just to make you glow
it's just the way you are when you're overgrown
i'm chasing down light in the indigo
it's just the way you are when you're overgrown
and i will never let you go
no i will never let you go

did i, did i, did i do you wrong?
did i, did i, did i do you right?

beyond the oceansize, i'm unaware
locked out the other side
like i was never there
like i was never there

they said the boat had sailed
i'd left them bare
oh how the wind would wail
like i was never there
like i was never there

oh my friends
i am heavy
can i beat within your heart?
can i bleed within your love?
oh my friends

beyond the oceansize, i'm unaware
locked out the other side
like i was never there
like i was never there

i lost my only space
to empty stares
oh how the light would change
like i was never there
like i was never there

oh my friends
i am heavy
can i beat within your heart?
can i bleed within your love?
oh my friends

there's a space in between
like a grey evergreen
where the hurt never meant
starts to linger
on the pavement below
see a crack that i know
all the corners of you
all the bones that i knew
i said i would never come back
screaming at the walls in jet black
hurt until my words are out flat
can i whisper it back?

what a waste, what a waste
what a waste to be so alone
a waste, what a waste
what a waste to be so alone
a waste, what a waste
what a waste to be so alone

there's a space in between
like a grey evergreen
where the hurt never mend
starts to linger
on the pavement below

screaming at the walls in jet black
hurt until my words are out flat
can i whisper it back?

she knew exactly who i was becoming
reality of dreams, younger for memories of a still wonder
of who i might be
and for her it's hard to stomach what's left behind and what's to come in the same introduction of a king
just know everything coming can only give birth to the principle that by any means
i produce like eagles
soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
so i can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
while these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
to write stories, a young poetic genius
and i mean this, there's never been a day off
never been laid off, my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off
get a break off just to rehire myself
for the take off
beach house... the ep

i feel in the beginning, we were living
we were tripping, we were so high
when you told me that you love me, were you bluffin'?
was it nothing? now you're so dry
you can tell me that you're sorry
but i know that you don't mean it, baby, don't lie
don't lie, baby, don't lie

and i can't blame myself
for getting lost inside the promise of you
and i can't blame you leaving
'cause what's meant to be will always be true

there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
to keep you here, ah
there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
don't leave me here, all alone

i ride for my baby
i died for my baby
i'd die for my baby, no lie
there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
in the atmosphere

remember we were running up and down
and getting messy in the hallways
told me that forever was the time we'd be together, baby, always
now you're saying that you're sorry
but i know that you don't mean it 'cause you won't stay
no you won't stay, you won't stay

and i can't blame myself
for getting lost inside the promise of you
and i can't blame you leaving
'cause what's meant to be will always be true

there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
to keep you here, ah
there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
don't leave me here, all alone

i ride for my baby
i died for my baby
i'd die for my baby, no lie
there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
in the atmosphere

if there's winners and losers, then i'll be the loser
i'm still here, i choose ya
i don't want another, if we can't have each other
'cause baby, i love ya
maybe in a different world, baby, i could be your girl
maybe then i'll be with you
if there's winners and losers, then i'll be the loser
i'm still here, i choose ya

there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
to keep you here, ah
there isn't enough love in the atmosphere
don't leave me here, all alone

i ride for my baby
i died for my baby
i'd die for my baby, no lie
there isn't enough love in the atmosphere

they better believe as soon as they creep up

twista spit it for hustlers, twista spit it for hoes
but i'm 'bout servin' these haters like i'm servin' that 'dro
spit for my gangstas and killers that'll put one in yo' dome
spit it for my ballers and thugs that's addicted to chrome
either rims or the thumper, now you ain't gotta wonder
what a twista and here i go and never on drama
with purple 'bout a pound, and my truck i pound the sounds
and my 24's got blades on them that spin round and round
back on the scene now, and i'm always seen high
still flow motion overdosin, smokin' on green now
when i'm on them jordans, 20's look like 17's now
sportin throwback jordans from when i was 17 now
album comin' out soon, but i already had props
pullin benz's up on the block before i met yo' pop

the twista, playa balla, slash pimp mc
straight from chi-tizzle my nizzle, never gon' get rid of me
when they drop on how pop on about how it's so fly bein me
with a lethal chemistry, put them in your memory
when you want that original sound, it's either him or me
the most underrated artist in this whole industry
if rappin' was the nba i'd be michael finley
still i'm bendin and grinnin, still i got pull in the club
still i'm poppin' my collar, grindin on girls in the club
servin' 50's, rims is bigger but i got love for the dub
they love the twist' like love for the chief, and love for the thug
'cause i got that com' game, and i got that bomb flame
let alarms ring when you hear the don's name
i copped the h-2-1's, some throwbacks like lebron james
this time around i'ma let my nuts and my platinum charms hang

t be poppin' them tags, t be coppin them jags
and if the t do a stick-up you be droppin' them bags
and i'm from where they cock hats instead of rockin' them rags
and if they ain't cockin them hats they be cockin them mags
t be thuggin' and clubbin, "oh twista that look tight"
don't every time he step in the party he look so nice?
i'm officially fresh in my gear as i'm rockin' mo' ice
and the mitchell and ness from the year when i used to flow like
annilisms are my verbal metabolisms
shadow's prisms and my thug mannerism's of cataclysm manor
causin some dis-establishment-arianism
i vary in wisdom, wins only 'cause i'm carryin ism and um
a street lyrical phantom, full of verses when i chant 'em

bone thugs, twista, dj khaled, listennn!

shouts out to steve lobel

tripping over myself,
i'm aching begging you to come help
and now that i'm without your kisses

think i don't need a girl to be alright
guess i didn't know

thought i didn't need shoes on my feet
thought i didn't need a bed to fall asleep
thought i didn't need love to be complete
guess i didn't know

that i just got this crazy feeling
i've been making someone wait for me, for me

you're all i think about when i'm awake
and everything's a mess when you're away
now i know

all of this is getting really old
i'm having trouble sleeping on my own
feeling like a house but not a home

that you give me this crazy feeling
and you won't have to wait no more for me, for me

and i just got this crazy feeling
i've been making someone wait for me


she would not show that she was afraid,
but being and feeling alone was too much to face,
though everyone said that she was so strong,
what they didn't know is that she could barely carry on,

but she knew that she would be okay,
so she didn't let it get in her way,

sometimes it all gets a little too much,
but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
and you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much,

she would always tell herself she could do this
she would use no help it would be just fine
but when it got hard she would lose her focus
so take my hand and we'll be alright

and she knew that she would be okay,
so she didn't let it get in her way,

sometimes it all gets a little too much,
but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
and you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah.

a little too much, i said a little too much, oh.

sometimes it all gets a little too much,
but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
and you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much yeah!

sometimes it all gets a little too much,
but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
and you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much.


i watch your troubled eyes as you rest
and i fall in love with every breath
wonder if those eyes are really shut
and am i the one you're dreaming of?

'cause underneath the darkness
there's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
and i know this 'cause i've noticed
a little bit shining through the seams

and if this is what it takes
then let me be the one to bear the pain
ooh, if this is what it takes
i'll break down these walls that are in our way
if this is what it takes

you keep on telling me i'm wasting time
but to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
and you think it's crazy what i'm trying to do
well baby, i'm a fool for you

'cause underneath the darkness
there's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
and i know this 'cause i've noticed
a little bit shining through the seams, yeah

and if this is what it takes
then let me be the one to bear the pain
ooh, if this is what it takes
i'll break down these walls that are in our way

'cause if you don't understand yet
then i'll never let you forget
that you don't have to do this on your own
i'll be your shoulder to lean on
i'll be your right when you feel wrong
so come on, take my hand, we're moving on

and if this is what it takes
then let me be the one to bear the pain
ooh, and if this is what it takes
i'll break down these walls,
these walls that are in our way

taking it slow isn't easy
if as far as you go
is only half as far as you and i both know, yeah
coming up from above
a little something and it's only because
i don't ever wanna see you in love, but i know

that you've been coming off strong lately
and i can feel it, that you've been thinking that maybe
you got a, another shot at me
thinking possibly somehow, but not now
and it's been spinning around like a hurricane
and the sound of the thunder that's beating my head to the ground
but i, i know

that i can't go back to this, to her
to what we used to have
it's black and burnt
my god, this is so sad
it'll only make things worse if we bring it back

and i mean, if you believe
that there is something still between you and me
then baby honestly yeah, you're not the one for me

and i can't go back to this, to her
to what we used to have
it's black and burnt
my god, this is so sad
it'll only make things worse if we bring it back

from where i'm standing
you've got me thinking what we could be 'cause

i need to tell you how i feel when i see us together forever

in my dreams, you're with me
we'll be everything i want us to be
and from there, who knows?
or is that just me and my imagination?

walking by the ocean side
our hands are gently intertwined
a feeling i just can't describe

and all this time we spent alone
thinking we could not belong
to something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

i keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

when i wake up to your footsteps
as you get up out of bed
they make a song that sounds so simple
but it dances in my head
a melody so perfect
that it gets me through the day
and the thought of us forever
is one that won't ever go away

all i need to know is
where to stop
take my hand and show me forever
so never will i ever let you go

so let's hold on together
to this paper and this pen
and write down every letter
to every word we've ever said

all i need to know is
where to stop
take my hand and show me forever
so never will i ever let you go

let's write our story
and let's sing a song
let's hang our pictures on the wall
all these precious moments
that we carved in stone
are only memories after all

it's taking it's toll
deep in my soul
now i've got to let go

that we carved in stone
are only memories after all

you take me places that tear up my reputation
manipulate my decisions

when we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
every moment was so precious, then
i'm still kicking it, i'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
the entire earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
i should say and you should hear i've loved
i've loved the good times here, i've loved our good times here

say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
we are all mortals, aren't we? any moment this could go
cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
but you should know, you should hear, that i have loved
i have loved the good times here, and i will miss our good times here

spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
and millions are left behind while the sky burns
there wasn't room for you and i, only you, goodbye, goodbye

now the sky, could be blue, i don't mind
without you it's a waste of time
could be blue, i don't mind
without you it's a waste of time

the sky could be blue, could be grey
without you i'm just miles away
the sky could be blue, i don't mind
without you it's a waste of time


i think i started somethin', i got what i wanted
did didn't i can't feel nothin', superhuman
zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion
i blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile
stripper booty and a rack like wow, brain like berkeley
met her at coachella, i went to see jigga, she went to see z trip, perfect
i took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
she said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
for tuition doin' porn in the valley, at least you workin'
but girl i can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway
she said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of

novocaine, baby, baby, novocaine, baby, i want you
love me now, when i'm gone, love me none
love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', i'm feelin' like
been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
i blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile
stripper booty with the rack like wow, i'll never forget ya
you put me on a feelin' i never had, never had, never had
and ever since i've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
now i'm somethin' like the chemist on campus
but there's no drug around, quite like what i found in you
i still can't feel my face, what am i smokin' anyway
she said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of

novocaine, baby, baby, novocaine, baby, i want you
love me now, when i'm gone, love me none
love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

novocaine for the pain

pretty girls involved with me
makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity

makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity

i can't feel a thing
i can't feel her
novocaine for the pain


i believe jehovah jireh
i believe there's heaven, i believe in war
i believe a woman's temple
gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
i believe that marriage isn't
between a man and woman but between love and love
and i believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
but you must believe in something, something, something
you gotta believe in something, something, something

i still believe in man
a wise one asked me why
'cause i just don't believe we're wicked
i know that we sin but i do believe we try
we all try, the girls try, the boys try
women try, men try, you and i try, try, we all try

i don't believe in time travel
i don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
i don't believe our lives are simple
and i don't believe they're short, this is interlude
i don't believe my hands are cleanly
can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
she didn't believe me when i said that i lost my faith
you must believe in something, something, something
you gotta believe in something, something, something

i still believe in man
a wise one asked me why
'cause i just don't believe we're wicked
i know that we sin but i do believe we try
we all try, the girls try, the boys try
women try, men try, you and i try, try, we all try


- stop! let me go! you don't got no jodeci?

and you could teach me how to slow dance or something
and i'mma give you chills harmonizing to otis, isley, marvin

and every time somebody asked me
if i sing songs to get at women, i say yeah
they say no fair no fair that's cheating

they say no fair, no fair that's cheating
i say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
you'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah

now i'm in the lab, always working late
always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
she used to stop by, come and holla at me
put her purse down and try to battle rap me
don't even listen to the songs i record
but she be banging that drake in my car
i'm so far gone, she stay blasting trey and his songs

now every time somebody asks me
if i sing songs to get at women
i say naw they say okay i don't believe it
i say nope i swear i never do it
if i sing songs to get at women, i say naw
they say who do you think you're kidding
i know you, you stole my girlfriend
now see i just don't play fair, but it's fair enough
cause yo girl broke my heart in half
now i'm singing 'bout heartbreak
and now i'm singing 'bout love lost

finna do a lovecrime, lovecrime, finna do a lovecrime

murder, murder, murder she wrote

is it really wrong that i want to be the baby daddy?
is that a lovecrime, lovecrime? tell me it's a lovecrime

murder, murder, murder she wrote
lovecrimes, lovecrimes

who's that talking in the library?

is that you? no, i won't put you out

nothing special
every book in here i wrote
some i'm not too proud of, some i wish i could burn

but there's no erasing and the best advice i got
was keep writing, yeah, and keep living, yeah
and keep loving, oh, loving, loving, loving

and when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
so will we turn to dust, so will we, dust, dust

ah
american love, american me
american you, american tear
american heartbreak
oh oh oh

i took a walk with the palm trees, as the daylight fell
sangria in the canteen, talkin' to myself
this tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
my pretty woman in a ball gown, i'm richard gere in a tux
gettin' married in the courthouse, writing vows in a rush
makin' out before the judge, with my teenage wife
got a wedding band done, that i just might die with

it's an american wedding
they don't mean too much but we were so in love
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours, that's american law

m-r-s dot kennedy, she signed her name in pen
in a fancy fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
a thesis on islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-american girls
after school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
this is the home of the brave, land of the free
but your, parents still didn't know
she said, "i've had a hell of a summer, so baby, don't take this hard
but maybe we should get an annulment before this goes way too far"

it's just an american wedding
they don't mean too much, they don't last enough
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours, american divorce

well you can have my mustang, that's all i've got in my name
but jesus christ don't break my heart, this wedding ring won't ever wipe off
you'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the usa

don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
we been some hustlers since it began dude
they so vain i tell 'em this ain't you
that she can't do, that he can't do
that you can't do, that we can't do
that she can't do, that he can't do
that you can't do, that we can't do
that she can't do, that he can't do
that you can't do

me and my eve trying out our first positions
and it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me
playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you

give it you over again, over again over again
over again over again, over again over again
making love, underneath the cherry leaves
baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
baby girl, i'll give it to you naturally, naturally

let's see, i have, ooh yeah, i'mma make myself a hot link when i get home

you out here flying high

high, high
but fly alone

you always smoking in the house
what if my mother comes over
you can't get up and get a job
'cause this little hustle's getting you by
you're the dealer and the stoner
with the sweetest kiss i've ever known

i know what i was on
i had a pilot jones
she took me high
then she took me home
pilot jones, pilot jones

i just don't know why
i keep on trying to keep a grown woman sober
see there you go reaching up your blouse
and no i don't want a child
but i ain't been touched in a while
by the dealer and the stoner
with the sweetest kiss i've ever known

i know what i was on
i had a pilot jones
she took me high
then she took me home
pilot jones, pilot jones

in the sky up above the birds
i saw the sky like i never seen before you
thought i was above you
above this in so many ways
but if i got a condo on a cloud
then i guess you can stay at my place
i'ma get one
i need ya
i admit it
you're my pilot jones


you don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
in the middle of arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
used to date a blonde
you used to hit it raw
'cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved

hittin' stones in glass homes
you're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and broke your home
crack rock, crack rock
crack rock, crack rock

hittin' stones in glass homes
you're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
you're hittin' stones and broke your home
crack rock, crack rock
crack rock, crack rock

you're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
to get the fixing that you're itching for
your family stopped inviting you to things, won't let you hold their infant
you used to get a little cut up from time to time
but the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

hittin' stones in glass homes
you're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and you broke your home
crack rock, crack rock, crack rock

crooked cop, dead cop, how much dope can you push to me?
crooked cop, dead cop, you're no good for community
my brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound

don't no one hear the rounds, ooh, sound
don't no one hear the shells, ooh, shells
don't no one hear a sound
don't no one disturb the peace for riot

oh, oh, oh, oh, there's a thief out on the move
oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
oh, oh, oh, oh, they have taken cleopatra, cleopatra


and we'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
in a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
as we march to rhythm on the palace floor
chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

oh, oh, oh, oh, set the cheetahs on the loose
aye, aye, aye, there's a thief out on the move
oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
aye, aye, they have taken cleopatra, cleopatra

the jewel of africa, jewel
what good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
how could you run off on me? how could you run off on us?
you feel like god inside that gold
i found you laying down with samson and his full head of hair
found my black queen cleopatra, bad dreams, cleopatra

oh, oh, remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
oh, oh, our war is over, our queen has met her doom
oh, no more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
oh, no more, it has killed cleopatra, cleopatra

big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
wake up to your girl, for now let's call her cleopatra, cleopatra
i watch you fix your hair then put your panties on in the mirror, cleopatra
then your lipstick, cleopatra, then your six inch heels, catch her


pimpin' in my convos
bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
floor model tv with the vcr
got rubies in my damn chain
whip ain't go no gas tank but it still got wood grain
got your girl working for me
hit the strip and my bills paid that keep my bills paid

baby, you know how to drive in rain, and you decided not to make a change;
stuck in the same old lane, going the wrong way home...

i feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
traffic - i'm under pressure, 'cause i can't have you the way that i want;
let's just go back to the way it was,
when we were on honeymoon avenue, honeymoon avenue, baby,
coastin' like crazy - can we get back to the way it was?

hey, what happened to the butterflies? guess they didn't count at that stop sign,
and my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light...

they say only fools fall in love;
well, they must've been talking about us,
and sometimes, i feel like we've been here before...
i could be wrong, but i know i'm right...
we gon' be lost if we continue to fight;
honey, i know we can find our way home...

i feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper
traffic - i'm under pressure, 'cause i can't have you the way that i want;
let's just go back to the way it was,
when we were on honeymoon avenue, honeymoon avenue, my baby,

honeymoon avenue, honeymoon avenue...)


baby, i got love for thee so deep inside of me, i don't know where to start;
i love you more than anything, but the words can't even touch what's in my heart...

when i try to explain it, i'd be sounding insane;
the words don't ever some out right...

all i'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,

see, baby, i've been feeling you before i even knew what feelings were about...

when i try to explain it, i'd be sounding all crazy;
words don't ever come out right...


if it's even possible, i love you more
than the word "love" can say it - it's better not explaining,
that's why i keep saying "baby, i..."

all i'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,

all i'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby,
every time i try to say it, words can only complicate it...




sean don!
okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title;
spent a hour in the bathroom, walk out looking like a model...
god! doing what you do, got me right there with apollo,

finally the stars align...
never has it been so easy
to be in love, and to give you this heart of mine...

if my benz turned back to public transportation?
would you still be at home for me, with the candles waiting
and get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
a player too - you know i had some girls missionary;
my black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary,
and bible, i got it recycled - i love and i like you.
five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-through,
that's why i got you...


'cause you listen, and you care;
you're so different, no one compares,
and if you never change, i'm gonna stay right there;
i'll always be right there...

so just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me, and i'll show you
how much i wanna be on your tattooed heart...

and kiss me underneath the moonlight;
darlin', let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart...

and talk to me for a little, baby, won't you loosen up just a little?

thought that i'd never fall in love, never fall in love again...

'cause you give me chills every time we chill;

but i'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
that makes you wanna dance - don't it make you wanna dance?

and you should follow through to make it alright...
now grab each others' hands, get on up;
i want to see you rock to the piano, the piano...

i love it, i love it...
i love the way you make me feel;
i love it, i love it...

say... i'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour,
do my singing in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like,
i ain't a player, i just crush a lot...

you give me that kind of something,
want it all the time, need it every day...
on a scale of one to ten, i'm at a hundred;
never get enough, i can't stay away...

if you want it, i got it, i got it every day;
you can get whatever you need from me...
stay by your side, i'll never leave you,
and i ain't going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper

so don't you worry - baby, you got me...

and i don't care who sees it, babe;
i don't wanna hide the way i feel when you're next to me...


ooh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin',
when you put your lips on mine
'cause boy, i know just what you like...

so if you need it, i got it, i got it every day;

now you finally tell me how you feel;
guess your words just came a little too late...
all the drama, boy, it's overkill;
don't be mad at me 'cause you've been replaced - know your place!

but if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up, told me how you really felt,
then maybe it'd be different - if you spoke, i would've listened, but now i'm with somebody else...
and he loves me too much for me to mess this up,
and it sucks to be all in your head, wondering where this thing could go, but...

you will never know what we could have been;
if you would've shown me way back then...
now you'll never know, you'll never know...

now it's probably hard for you to hear,

you will never know what we could have been;

but now, you'll never know, you'll never know...

it's not my fault you're a little bit too late;
you're the only one to blame - wipe that look off your face...
you can wish a thousand times, but none of that will change my mind, boy;
you had a chance you'll never get back, get back...

you will never know what we could have been;
if you would've shown me way back then...
now you'll never know... oh, baby!

but now, you'll never know, you'll never know...

you will never know! ooh...

how soon do we forget how we felt?
dealing with emotions, that never left,
playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game.

maybe i'm the sinner, and you're the saint,
gotta stop pretending what we ain't.
why we pointing fingers, anyway, when we're the same?

break up, make up, total waste of time,
can we please make up our minds,
and stop acting like we're blind

'cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
you know, i'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'cause you're the best mistake i've ever made,
but we hold on, hm, hold on.
there's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
but we hold on, hm, hold on, yeah.

i guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking,
how can we keep the feelings fresh? how do we ziploc it?
wear your heart up on your sleeve, so watch out for pickpockets.
i guess to go the distance, we might need to pit stop it.
hold up - i know love could be a beach with no shore,
i done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four.
i know sometimes it's hard to realize i'm the man that you need,
i had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh.
and i feel like that everything we do is overdue,
you ask why i love your mom so much? 'cause she's a older you.
i wish that you were happy, i guess that's the one thing i should be providing;
ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones, and we the oddest,
couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess;
only lying to you when i lie you down, just being honest.
when you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back;
if i'm not the one, then i'm the best mistake you ever had.

break up, make up, total waste of time;
can we please make up our minds
and stop acting like we're blind

'cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining,
stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy,
you know, i'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

'cause you're the best mistake i've ever made,
but we hold on, hmm, hold on.
there's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase,
but we hold on, hmm, hold on, yeah.

you're, you're, you're, you're,
mmm, i'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

you're, you're, you're, you're,
mmm, i'll be savin' my love for you, for you.

i cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
and then it was clear - i can't deny, i really miss him...
to think that i was wrong;
i guess you don't know what you got till it's gone...
pain is just a consequence of love;
i'm saying sorry for the sake of us...

he wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
and now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
'cause you are, you are, you are my everything...
you are, you are, you are my everything...

i know you're not far, but i still can't handle all the distance;
you're travelling with my heart - i hope this is a temporary feeling,
'cause it's too much to bear
without you, and i know sorry ain't the cure...
if i cross your mind, just know i'm yours,
'cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are...

you weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time i push my pride away...
you are, you are, you are my everything...
you are, you are, you are my everything...

you are, you are, you are...
you are, you are, you are... my everything...


i know what she's like
she's out of her mind
and wraps herself around the truth
she'll jump on that flight
make you tear up the room

she loves when everybody's watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
she loves nobody else but you


she'll dance in the dark
a real work of art
her eyes could burn down the room
so get out while you can
you don't understand
she doesn't know how to lose

she loves when everybody's watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
she loves nobody else but you


she'll run with your mind and pull you in tight
then trade you in for something new
i know what it's like, i fell for it twice
and now i'm just warning you

she loves when everybody's watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
that she loves nobody else but you

she loves when everybody's watching
she knows the way her body moves
she loves the way they all crawl back when she says
she loves nobody else but you

she's on the loose
she's on the loose


waking up to kiss you and nobody's there
the smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
it's hard
yesterday i thought i saw your shadow running round
it's funny how things never change in this old town

so far from the stars
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now

if the whole world was watching i'd still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth

everything comes back to you

i saw that you moved on with someone new
in the pub that we met he's got his arms around you

it's so hard
so hard

and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now

'cause if the whole world was watching i'd still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you

you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when i'm next to you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you

and i know that it's wrong
that i can't move on
but there's something about you
if the whole world was watching i'd still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth

everything comes back to you
you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when i'm next to you

over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you



we should take this back to my place
that's what she said right to my face
'cause i want you bad, yeah i want you baby
i've been thinking 'bout it all day
'cause i want you bad, yeah i want you baby

slow, slow hands
like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
no, no chance
that i'm leaving here without you on me
i know, yeah, i already know that there ain't no stopping
slow hands

i just wanna take my time
'cause i want you bad, yeah i want you baby

slow, slow hands
like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
no, no chance
that i'm leaving here without you on me
i know, yeah, i already know that there ain't no stopping

fingertips putting on a show
got me now and i can't say no
wanna be with you all alone
take me home, take me home
fingertips putting on a show

slow, slow hands
like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
no, no chance
that i'm leaving here without you on me
i know, yeah, i already know that there ain't no stopping
slow, slow hands
like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
no, no chance
that i'm leaving without you
i know, yeah, i already know that there ain't no stopping
slow hands, slow hands


waiting here for someone
only yesterday we were on the run
you smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
now i'm waiting here for someone

and oh, love, do you feel this rough?
why's it only you i'm thinking of

my shadow's dancing
without you for the first time
my heart is hoping
you tell me there are things that you regret
'cause if i'm being honest i ain't over you yet
it's all i'm asking
is it too much to ask?
is it too much to ask?

someone's moving outside
the lights come on and down the drive
i forget you're not here when i close my eyes
do you still think of me sometimes?

and oh, love, watch the sun coming up

my shadow's dancing
without you for the first time
my heart is hoping
you tell me there are things that you regret
'cause if i'm being honest i ain't over you yet
it's all i'm asking
is it too much to ask?

my shadow's dancing
without you for the first time
my heart is hoping
you tell me there are things that you regret
'cause if i'm being honest i ain't over you yet

my shadow's dancing
without you for the first time
my heart is hoping
you tell me there are things that you regret
'cause if i'm being honest i ain't over you yet
it's all i'm asking
is it too much to ask?

it's all i'm asking
is it too much to ask?
it's all i'm asking
is it too much to ask?


in this house of broken hearts
we made our love out of stacks of cards
and yes, we tried to hold on tight
'cause we knew our love was hard to find

and our paper houses reach the stars
'til we break and scatter worlds apart
yeah, i paid the price and own the scars
why did we climb and fall so far?

we held our cards, built them high
but way too close to the light
so turn your head and let us go
i learned to breathe on my own

and our paper houses reach the stars
'til we break and scatter worlds apart
yeah, i paid the price and own the scars
why did we climb and fall so far?

yeah, our paper houses reach the stars
'til we break and scatter worlds apart
i don't wanna lose your touch
i don't wanna hurt this much
i can feel you slipping away

yeah, i paid the price and own the scars
why do we climb and fall so far?

why do we climb to fall so far?


like the rain on a sunny day
there's a shadow behind your face
tell me what you're running from
i don't know what made you so afraid
don't you know you got the best of me?
yeah, you're everything i want

anyone can see
anyone can see
your heartache, heartache
you can talk to me
it's more than skin deep
but i'm trying, yeah

since we're alone
yeah, you can show me your heart
if you put it all in my hand
no, i swear
no, i won't break it apart
since we're alone

when you feel your love's been taken
when you know there's something missing
in the dark, we're barely hangin' on
then you rest your head upon my chest
and you feel like there ain't nothing left
i'm afraid that what we had is gone

then i think of the start
and it echoes a spark
and i remember the magic electricity
then i look in my heart
there's a light in the dark
still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
that i wanna keep
please don't leave
please don't leave

when you lay there and you're sleeping
hear the patterns of your breathing
and i tell you things you've never heard before
asking questions to the ceiling
never knowing what you're thinking
i'm afraid that what we had is gone

then i think of the start
and it echoes a spark
and i remember the magic electricity
then i look in my heart
there's a light in the dark
still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
that i wanna keep
please don't leave
please don't leave

and i want this to pass
and i hope this won't last
last too long

then i think of the start
and it echoes a spark
and i remember the magic electricity
then i look in my heart
there's a light in the dark
still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
that i wanna keep
please don't leave
please don't leave


you keep saying that you're alright
but i can see it through your fake smile, you're not
there's a reservoir in your eyes
that you've been holding back a long time, what's wrong?

darling, you don't have to hold it
you don't have to be afraid
you can go ahead and unload it
'cause you know it'll be okay
fire away
fire away

hold me close but at a distance
thinking that i never listen, but i do
i know sometimes it gets confusing
you might be lost but i ain't losing you

darling, you don't have to hold it
you don't have to be afraid
you can go ahead and unload it
'cause you know it'll be okay
fire away, hm
fire away
fire away
fire away

and i will steady your hand
when you're losing your grip
even if i don't understand
you can talk to me
and i will steady your hand
when you're losing your grip
and even if i don't understand
you can talk to me
fire away
fire away
fire away
fire away
fire away


i got a young heart
and it's wild and free
i don't know where it starts
but it ends with you and me

i don't where i'm going
but i get back to you and me

'cause we're two kids
trying to start a fight
no matter where we go
yeah, we'll be alright
all i'm asking for
a bit of patience, please
'cause i know what's to come
and it's coming for you and me

time has never been on our side
so would you wait for me?
i lead a selfish life
'cause that's what i need
what do i have to do
to make you believe?

from a distance
i can hear you cry
but don't you worry, darlin'
i can promise it
i can guarantee
at the end of the road
i see you with me

time has never been on our side
so would you wait for me?
i lead a selfish life
'cause that's what i need
what do i have to do
to make you believe?
it's all for you and me

that it ends with you and me

i'd stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on
and walk out with a million bucks
then i'd burn it in a pile out on your front lawn
just to prove it didn't mean that much
i'd sell everything i own, take a pile of cash
walk into the casino, blow it all on black
then blow all of my winnings on a limousine
to make out with you in the back, hey

say this whole world can know you're all i need
cause baby some day i'll drop and hit one knee and tell you

when i see you hitting me up
feeling so electrified
with the heat of a million suns
you know just one touch can keep me high
and i think i'll never come down
till a couple days go by
and you're nowhere to be found

all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
it's a crime
it's a crime
how you're reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry

so i try to shake you out my head
try to dance with somebody new
but you got those lips so red
and that smoking voice, you do
so i know it's pointless anyway
cause there ain't nobody else
that could light me up so bright
and break this crazy spell

all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
it's a crime
it's a crime
how you're reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry

if i wait a little longer
then maybe you'll come back around
wait a little longer
then maybe you'll be ready now
'cause i would wait forever
for you to fall back into my arms
so come on

all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
it's a crime
it's a crime
how you're reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry
all the things that you said to me yesterday
playing over in my mind
it's a crime
it's a crime
how you're reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry
how you're reeling me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry

if this is your first time hearin' this
you are about to experience somethin' so cold, man

but as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman
only adult man i knew that wasn't broke, man
flickin' starter coats, man
man, you don't know, man
we don't care what people say
'cause this summer they ain't finna say, "next summer i'm finna"
sittin' in the hood like community colleges
this dope money here is little trey's scholarship
'cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
and ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
so we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
you gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

drug dealin' just to get by
stack ya' money till it get sky high
kids, sing, kids, sing
we wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
joke's on you, we still alive
throw your hands up in the sky and say
"we don't care what people say"

the second verse is for my dogs workin' nine to five that still hustle
and everybody sellin' makeup, jacob's and bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
we claim other people kids on our income tax
we take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
and we don't care what people say
mama say she wanna move south
scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'round the same time, doe ran up in dude house
couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
the drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
but we gon' keep bakin' till the day we get cake

drug dealin' just to get by
stack ya' money till it get sky high
kids, sing, kids, sing
we wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
joke's on you, we still alive
throw your hands up in the sky and say
"we don't care what people say"

you know the kids gon' act a fool
when you stop the programs for after-school
and they dcfs, some of 'em dyslexic
they favorite 50 cent song "12 questions"
we scream, "rocks, blow, weed, park," see, now we smart
we ain't retards, the way teachers thought
hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
now tell my mama i belong in that slow class
sad enough we on welfare
they tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
i'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
they tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
when we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us

drug dealin' just to get by
stack ya' money till it get sky high
kids, sing, kids, sing
we wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
joke's on you, we still alive
throw your hands up in the sky and say
"we don't care what people say"


you will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
who told you see, i told you to do something uplifting
i'm tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
and i don't mean that in no nice way

i'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.
i'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.
i got something better than school but don't tell anybody.
my daddy would kill me so don't tell anybody.
he wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody.
he ain't walked in my shoes, i'm just not everybody.


oh when it all

man i promise, she's so self-conscious
she has no idea what she's doing in college
that major that she majored in don't make no money
but she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
now, tell me that ain't insecure
the concept of school seems so secure
sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
'cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs
'cause her baby-daddy don't really care
she's so precious with the peer pressure
couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off, now she look like eve
and she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
single black female addicted to retail and well

oh when it all, it all falls down

man i promise, i'm so self-conscious
that's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollies and pasha's done drove me crazy
i can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
then i spent four-hundred bucks on this
and i can't even go to the grocery store
without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
it seems we living the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
we trying to buy back our forty acres
and for that paper, look how low we a stoop


we buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
we-a buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
things we buy to cover up what's inside
'cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
that's why shorties holler, "where the ballers at?"
drug dealer buy jordans, crackhead buy crack
and a white man get paid off of all of that
but i ain't even gonna act holier than thou
before i had a house and i'd do it again
'cause i want to be on 106 and park pushin' a benz
i want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
i got a couple past due bills, i won't get specific
i got a problem with spendin' before i get it
we all self-conscious, i'm just the first to admit it


oh when it all, it all falls down
i'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

i's can't keep working like this
this grave shift is like a slave shift


one glad morning
when this life is over
i'll fly away
to a land where
joy shall never end
i'll fly away

oh i'll fly away, oh glory
i'll fly away
when i die hallelujah bye and bye
i'll fly away



man, man, man
if my manager insults me again, i will be assaulting him
let's go back, back to the gap, look at my check, wasn't no scratch
so if i stole, wasn't my fault, yeah i stole, never got caught
they take me to the back and pat me askin' me about some khakis
but let some black people walk in, i bet you they show off their token blackie
oh now they love kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
so i'm on break next to the "no smokin'" sign with a blunt in the mall
takin' my hits, writing my hits, writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
y'all don't know my struggle, y'all can't match my hustle
you can't catch my hustle, you can't fathom my love
dude, lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers
that's a different world like cree summer's, i deserve to do these numbers
"the kid that made that deserves that maybach"
so many records in my basement, i'm just waiting on my spaceship, wow


and i didn't even try to work a job, represent the mob at the same time
thirsty on the grind, chi state of mind, lost my momma, lost my mind
my life, my love, that's not mine, "why you ain't signed?" wasn't my time
leave me alone, work for y'all, half of it's yours, half of it's mine
only one to ball, never one to fall, got to get mine, got to take mine
got a tec-9, reach my prime, got to make these haters respect mine
in the mall until twelve when my schedule had said nine
putting them pants on shelves waiting patiently i ask myself
where i want to go, where i want to be
life is much more than running in the streets
holla at ye, hit me with the beat
put me on my feet, sound so sweet
yes i'm the same ol' g, same goatee, staying low key, nope
holler at god, "man why'd you have to take my folks?"
hope to see freddie g., yusef g, love my g
rolly g., police watch me smoke my weed, count my g's
got a lot of people counting on me and i'm just trying to find my peace
should've finished school like my niece then i finally wouldn't use my piece, blow
aw man, this pressure


man, you know you gon' do it
standing on my feet all damn day trying to make this thing right
and having one of my co-workers say "yo, you look just like
well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
no more broad service, cars, and them tv shows
i had all that snatched from me, a&amp;rs and they faculties
all turn their back on me and didn't want to hear a rap from me
so naturally actually had to face things factually
had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
'cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
i don't want to ever go back there
so i won't be taking no days off till my spaceship takes off


i want to fly, i want to fly
i said i want my chariot to pick me up and take me, brother, for a ride
heaven knows, heaven knows


yo
we at war
we at war with terrorism, racism
and most of all, we at war with ourselves


you know what the midwest is? young and restless
i walk through the valley of the chi where death is
top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
try to catch it, it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
they be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
we ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
a trunk full of coke, rental car from avis
my mama used to say only jesus can save us
well mama i know i act a fool
but i'll be gone till november, i got packs to move, i hope



now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see thee more clearly
i know he hear me when my feet get weary
'cause we're the almost nearly extinct
we rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
i ain't here to argue about his facial features
or here to convert atheists into believers
i'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
the way kathie lee needed regis, that's the way i need jesus
so here go my single dog, radio needs this
they say you can rap about anything except for jesus
that means guns, sex, lies, videotape
but if i talk about god my record won't get played, huh?
well if this take away from my spins
which'll probably take away from my ends
then i hope this take away from my sins
and bring the day that i'm dreamin' about
next time i'm in the club, everybody screamin' out



oh baby
hahahahaha, turn it up for me


yo, first i snatched the streets then i snatched the charts
first i had they ear, now i have their heart
rappers came and went, i've been here from the start
i seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
seen the rovers roll up with ribbons
i seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
so when i reload, he holds number one position, when you hot, i'm hot
and when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
this is not an image, this is god given
this is hard livin', mixed with cristal sippin'
it's the most consistent, hov
give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
it's hov tradition, jeff gordon of rap
i'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy


down for my grandfather who took my mama
made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
at the tender age of six she was arrested for the sit-ins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
but we can make it to jacob's and to the dealership
swear i hear new music and i just don't be feelin' it
racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
but i know they don't want me in the damn club
they even made me show id to get inside of sam's club
i done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
swear i've been baptized least three or four times
it's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
so i promised to mr. rainey i'm gonna marry your daughter
and you know i gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you see the car i bought her
you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
but i can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'cause look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watching me from the other side

when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i found, one thing i found
oh no you'll never let me down

we are all here for a reason on a particular path
you don't need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math
cats think i'm delirious but i'm so damn serious
that's why i expose my soul to the globe; the world
i'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
i'm not just another individual
my spirit is a part of this that's why i get spiritual
but i get my hymns from him
so it's not me, it's he that's lyrical
i'm not a miracle, i'm a heaven sent instrument
my rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
for your soul and your mental
that's why i'm instrumental, vibrations is what i'm into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that ain't what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
i'm trying to get us "us free" like cinque
i can't stop, that's why i'm hot
determination, dedication, motivation
i'm talking to you of my many inspirations
when i say i can't let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
and if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
in my grip i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it be known that god's penmanship has been signed
with a language called love
that's why my breath is felt by the deaf
and while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess i'm one of a kind in a full house
'cause whenever i open my heart, my soul or my mouth

when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i found, one thing i found
oh no you'll never let me down
get up i get, get up i get
get up i get, get up i get

built the roc from a pebble, peddled rock before i met you
let you tell it man i'm falling, well somebody must have caught him
every fourth quarter, i like to mike jordan them
number one albums what i got, like four of them
more of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
clear the way, i'm here to stay
y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
this is jay, dissing jay will get you maced
six hail mary's please father forgive us
they way y'all all follow jigga
hov's a living legend and i'll tell you why
everybody wanna be hov and hov's still alive

down, down
down, down
down, down


uh, uh, i'm trying to catch the beat
uh, i'm trying to catch the beat
i'm trying to catch the beat
uh, uh, i'm trying to catch the beat

now i ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
and if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high

n-n-n-now, my flow is in the pocket like wallets, i got the bounce like hydraulics
i can't call it, i got the swerve like alcoholics
my freshman year i was going through hella problems
till i built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
my teacher said i's a loser, i told her, "why don't you kill me?"
my heart, and if you follow the charts or the plaques or the stacks
you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
i'm so shy that you thought i was bashful
but this bastard's flow will bash your skull
and i will, cut your girl like pastor tro'
and i don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
and i won't, give you that money that you asking for
why you think me and dame cool? we assholes
that's why we hear your music in fast forward

now i ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
and if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high

telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly

get 'em high like noon or the moon
or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
y'all assumed i was doomed, out of tune
real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
control rap is out of
used to, but still got love
that's why i abuse you who are not thugs, rock clubs like tiger
woods in the hood, to have my own reality show, called soul survivor
how could i ever let your words affect me?
they say hip hop is dead, i'm here to resurrect me
marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
that's why the raw don't know your name, like alicia keys
too many featured emcees, and producers is popular
twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
album, how come? you the hot garbage of
the year's clear your image and snooped up

bolder than denver, i ain't a madd rapper, just an emcee with a temper
you dancing for money like honey, i did this my way
so when the industry crash, i survive like kanye
spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'

now i ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
and if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high

these are documented, my father left them to me

i'd like to propose a toast

so get your ass up off the wall

the all around the world digital underground pac
the rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the roc
i take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
ain't nobody expect kanye to end up on top
they expected that college dropout to drop and then flop
then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
my money was thinner than sean paul's goatee hair
now jean paul gaultier cologne fill the air, here
they say he bougie, he big-headed
would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
flow infectious, give me ten seconds
i'll have a buzz bigger than insects in texas
it's funny how wasn't nobody interested

so get your ass up off the wall

now was kanye the most overlooked? yes sir
now is kanye the most overbooked? yes sir
though the fans want the feeling of a tribe called quest
but all they got left is this guy called west
that'll take freeway, throw him on tracks with mos def
call him kwali or kweli, i put him on songs with jay-z
i'm the gap like banana republic and old navy, and ooh
it come out sweeter than old sadie
nice as bun-b when i met him at the source awards
girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards
and i was almost famous, now everybody love kanye, i'm almost raymond
some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
it was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
last year shoppin' my demo, i was tryin' to shine
now i could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
i use it as my gas, so they say that i'm gassed
but without it i'd be last, so i ought to laugh
so i don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
i'm kan, the louis vuitton don
bought my mom a purse, now she louis vuitton mom
i ain't play the hand i was dealt, i changed my cards
i prayed to the skies and i changed my stars
i went to the malls and i balled too hard
"oh my god, is that a black card?"
i turned around and replied, "why yes
but i prefer the term african american express"
brains, power, and muscle, like dame, puffy, and russell
your boy back on his hustle, you know what i've been up to
mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips

so get your ass up off the wall, all

so this a&amp;r over at roc-a-fella, named hip hop picked the "truth" beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me, you know, like i always do
i play the songs, he's like "who that spittin'?" i'm like "it's me," he's like "oh, well okay"
uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
just askin' me to send him beats, and i'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin' with
and um, he was friends with my mentor, no id
and no id told him, "look man, you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"
i was all, i dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
i was messin' with, uh, d-dot also
people were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how i got in the game
if it wasn't for that, i wouldn't be here
i was stayin' in chicago, i had my own apartment, i be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and buy, get a pelle pelle off layaway, get some jordans or something or get a technomarine, that's what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample
and at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me
so i went and um, i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time and really i just, like bit the drums off "xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled
and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "this can't be life"
and that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know, i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management
i really wanted to roll with hip hop 'cause i, i just needed some fresh air, you know what i'm sayin' 'cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
and that day, i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said, "oh you a real soulful dude"
and he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take
and he said, "tell me what you think of this"
and i heard it, and i was thinking like, "man, i really wanted more like of the simple type jay-z"
i ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion
so he asked me, "what you think of it?"
you know what i'm sayin', man what i'mma tell him?
i was on the train, man, you know
so after that i went back home and man i'm, i'm just in chicago, i'm trying to do my thing
you know, i got groups, i got acts i'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like, poppin' off the way it should have been
one of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed
but it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company
so, like i'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company
and i got evicted at the same time
so i went down and tracked the beats from him
so i ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk
me and my mother drove to newark, new jersey
i hadn't even seen my apartment
you know, we went to ikea, i bought a bed, i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat i made was, uh, "heart of the city"
and beans was still working on his album at that time, so i came up there to baseline, it was beans' birthday, matter of fact, and i played like seven beats
and, you know i guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, i had did "nothing like it" already at that time
but then jay walked in, i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
i remember it like, like it was yesterday
and hip hop said, "yo play that one beat for him"
so i played "heart of the city" and really i made "heart of the city," i really wanted to give that beat to dmx
and i played another beat, and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, "ooh"
two days later, i'm in baseline and i seen dame
dame didn't know who i was and i was like, "yo, what's up i'm kanye"
so, jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days
i gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story
the day i did the 'can't be life' beat on track, i remember lenny s., he had some louis vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly
and hip hop was there, i think ty-ty, john meneilly, a bunch of people
i didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and i said, "yo jay i could rap"
mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips"
and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line
that was it, you know, i ain't get no deal then, haha
okay, fast forward
so, blueprint, "h to the izzo," my first hit single
and i just took that proudly, built relationships with people, my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
man, yo, i appreciate, i love him for that
and at this time, you know i didn't have a deal, i had songs, and i had relationships with all these a&amp;r's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, i'd play them some beats
"gimme a beat that sound like jay-z," you know, they dick riders, whatever
be like, "yo but i rap too." hey, i guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here, i played them "jesus walks" and they didn't sign me
i'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
let's just say i didn't get my deal
the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol records
he wanted to sign me really bad
dame was like, "yo you got a deal with capitol? okay man, just make sure it's not wack"
then one day i just went ahead and played it, i wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know cam was in the room, young guru, and
dame was in the room
so i played, actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe i might use it
so, it's called "wow"
"i go to jacob with twenty-five thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
i got eleven plaques on my walls right now
don't bite that chorus, i might still use it
"i ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot"
like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper
and i'm sure dame figured, "like man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album, you know
so uh dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, b, b, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"
"you gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on"
i told hip hop and hip hop was all, "oh, word?"
actually, even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3h
that, you know, 'cause i told him i was gonna do it, and i'm a man of my word, i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do
then, you know, i'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer rapper" and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol, and right
the day i'm talking about, i planned out everything i was gonna do man, i had picked out clothes
i already started booking studio sessions, i started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man i was ready to go
and they had mel call me, they said, "yo
capitol pulled on the deal"
and, you know i told them that roc-a-fella was interested
and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever
i went up
i called g, i said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with roc-a-fella?"

so won't you raise your glass, won't you?
so won't you raise your glass, won't you?
so won't you raise your glass, won't you?
so won't you raise your glass, won't you?

uh, and i heard 'em say
"nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
and i heard 'em say
"nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
but we'll a find a way
it hurts but it may be the only way)

they say people in your life are seasons
and anything that happen is for a reason
and gram keep praying and keep believing
in jesus, and one day that you see him
till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
the devil is alive i feel him breathin'
claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
and put them lottery tickets just to tease us
my aunt pam can't put them cigarettes down
so now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
i can't figure it out, i'm sick of it now

uh, and i heard 'em say
"nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
and i heard 'em say
nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
but we'll a find a way
it hurts but it may be the only way)

with every worthless word, we get more far away
and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
and nothing last forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way

keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
back when we rocked ellesses, he had dreams of caprices
drove by the teachers, even more by polices
how'd he get the cash? the day his father passed away
left him with a little somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
hit lake shore, girls go all crazy
hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
see back-back then-then, if you had a car
you was the chi-town version of baby
and i was just a virgin, a baby
one of the reasons i looked up to him crazy
i used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
we'd take a saturday and just circle the mall
they had they lincolns and auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
with the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
so put me on with these hoes, homie
he told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

drive slow, homie
drive slow
you never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

what it do? i'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
the candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'lac
trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
i'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
allow me to introduce you to my cl mercedes
it's a star-studded event when i valet park
open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
you see them fours crawling? you see them screens falling?
the disco ball in my mouth insinuates i'm ballin'
i'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
but i could still catch boppers if i drove a cab
a young houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
i'm tipping on them fours, i'm jamming on that screw
i'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? drive slow, homie

live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie)

i got more tvs in here than where i live)
and everything i flip, you know it's something serious
i got the custom grill, i got the brabus rims
i got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
you see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
i got my custom kicks, i got my jesus chain
my canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
they see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
with that mean lean, smoking on that finest cali green
my woodgrain oak, i'm ridin' on vogues
my cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
i sold o's, and this i know
when you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow

yeah, drive slow, homie
drive slow, homie
you never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
you need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
drive slow, homie


yeah

they say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
i stroll where souls get lost like vegas
seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
pray to god that my arms reach the masses
the young smoke grass in grassless jungles
rubber band together in cashless bundles
we wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
someone to stay in they corner like mike tyson
hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
children are unheld, i wish love was for sale
behold the pale horse got me trapped like r. kell, i bail and it

might not be such a bad idea if i never, never went home again
i'm on my way home
i left three days ago, but no one seems to know i'm gone
home is where the hatred is
home is filled with pain and it
might not be such a bad idea if i never, never went home again




how we stop the black panthers?
ronald reagan cooked up an answer
you hear that? what gil scott was hearing
when our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
crack raised the murder rate in d.c. and maryland
we invested in that, it's like we got merrill lynched
and we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
sometimes i feel the music is the only medicine
so we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it sell it
the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
put the cd on your tongue, yeah that's pure man



from the place where the father's gone, the mothers is hardly home
and the madigon's lock us up in the audy home
how the mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
they wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
who gave saddam anthrax?
george bush got the answers
back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
arm &amp; hammer baking soda raised they own quota
right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'cause, dreams of being hova
went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
to bein' the president, look there's hope man
this that inspiration for the moes and the folks man
shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
and this is the soundtrack
this the type of music that you make when you 'round that



god, how could you let this happen?
happen, happen
happen, happen
happen

uh, that's that crack music, crack music
that real black music, black music


that's that crack music, crack music
that real black music, black music

our father, give us this day, our daily bread
before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
and to atone, i throw a little somethin' somethin' on the pulpit
and what we gave back was crack music
and now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
so our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
and we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
now the former slaves trade hooks for grammys
this dark diction has become america's addiction
those who ain't even black use it
we gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music


i know it's past visiting hours but can i please give her these flowers?
the doctor don't wanna take procedures, he claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
it'll send her body into a seizure, that little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
hey chick, i'm at a loss for words
what do you say at this time, "remember when i was nine?"
tell her everything gon' be fine, but i be lyin'
her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
i'm arguin like, "what kind of doctor can we fly in?"
you know the best medicine go to people that's paid
you telling me if my grandma's in the nba, right now she'd be okay?
but since she was just a secretary, worked for the church for thirty-five years
things supposed to stop right here, my grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong
that's where i get my confidence from
i asked the nurse, "did you do the research?"
she asked me, "can you sign some t-shirts?"
you don't see that we hurt? but still

i smile when rosie comes to see me
can't wait for the clouds to break

they outside of the emergency room, room, you can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
if she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon but right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
my mama say they say she could pass away anyday
hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
let me see the x-rays, i ain't no expert, i'm just hurt
cousin kim took off of work
plus my aunt shirley, aunt beverly, aunt clay, and aunt jean
so many aunties we could have an auntie team
feel like amerie, it's just one thing when they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
i think we at a all-time high to get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'cause with my family we know where home is so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses

i smile when rosie comes to see me
can't wait for the clouds to break
oh, rosie brings the sunshine, oh

i smile when roses comes to see me

tellin' you the truth now
said i can't wait, uh-uh
i won't wait, no


darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now
watching, watching, as the credits all roll down
crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house

no heroes, villains, one to blame
while wilted roses filled the stage
and the thrill, the thrill is gone
our debut was a masterpiece
but in the end for you and me
oh, the show, it can't go on

we used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
so hold for the applause, oh
and wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow

stranger things
'cause that's just who we are

we used to run around this ghost town
always thinking out loud
are we gonna get out
i remember
we dream of places that we could go
castles with the strange glow
people that we don't know
i remember

we left a life
that's ordinary from the start
we looked for stranger things
'cause that's just who we are
found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
like i'm picturing now

castles glitter under spanish skies
snow white mountains in a foreign state
tell me someday we'll get there
someday
someday
oh-oh
oh-oh

i see a technicolor shadow
underneath your window
just in case you don't know
i can see it
you cast an unfamiliar day glow
different than what i know
shining like a halo
i can feel it

we turned our back on ordinary from the start
we looked for stranger things
'cause that's just who we are
found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
show me the sky falling down

castles glitter under spanish skies
snow white mountains in an ancient place
tell me someday we'll get together
someday
someday
oh oh
oh oh

a stranger things
'cause that's just who we are

sitting at a bar with some friends
telling them the things that you said
left me with my heart in no hands
told me we'd be better just friends
staring at a television
something 'bout the world's gonna end

i think about you
you think about me too

if we're losing our minds
i'd get lost with you
if we're all gonna die
i wanna die with you

i wanna die with you
i wanna die with you

i've been seeing tears all morning
feel like my apartment's flooding
i don't even know where we left it
maybe i just need to take a shower
washing off the last ten hours
all i smell is coffee and cigarettes and you

i'm thinking about you
you think about me too

if we're losing our minds
i'd get lost with you
if we're all gonna die
i wanna die with you

i wanna die with you
i wanna die with you

thinking about you

if i losing in my minds
i'd get lost with you
if we're all gonna die
i wanna die with you

i wanna die with you
i wanna die with you


this is our last goodbye
don't come and find me
so hard to see you cry
please, somebody blind me

'cause i can feel it
i'm still lagging onto every word
my heart is beating
and i'm sorry that i left you hurt

we were kids in love
and then we grew up
like we're kids in love?
kids in love
kids in love
kids in love

we were kids in love
we were kids in love

engine on, in the drive
running for hours
slowly, we twist the knife in
folding like towers

and i can feel it
i hear you breathing
as we're hanging on to you and i, oh

we were kids in love
and then we grew up
like we're kids in love?

maybe i could cope if i could hold you
we were kids in love
one last time, one last time
and wherever you go, i'll just hold you forever
maybe i could cope if i could hold you
we were kids in love


you just, you made it look easy
it's like you didn't feel it
not like i do
i followed, i followed the pieces
i tried to receive it
to when it was good

oh look, i don't wanna feel like somebody
while nothing else ever feels like your body
'cause we held the world, we were turning it
for a moment there, it was permanent
i drive the streets when you told me your secrets
we made mistakes, but we both we didn't mean it
and we held the world, we were turning it
for a moment there, it was permanent

i'll bet, i'll bet you're in seoul
dancing in slow-mo
with someone new, oh
i cared, i, i hope you'll never forget it
like all your tattoos

oh look, i don't wanna feel like somebody
while nothing else ever feels like your body
'cause we held the world, we were turning it
for a moment there, it was permanent
i drive the streets when you told me your secrets
we made mistakes, but we both we didn't mean it
and we held the world, we were turning it
for a moment there, it was permanent

you're more than just a notch in my belt
a story to tell
the only thing on my mind
i know you're making magic somewhere
but not by yourself
that might be the reason why
i can smell you on the pillow where you used to lay
and it's keeping me up, oh

hoping when it opens i'll see you...
you...

you're more than just a notch in my belt
a story to tell
the only thing on my mind
it's obvious i'm not doing well
do you see these eyes, when have you known me to cry?
i'm just sitting here remembering how your lips taste
and it's keeping me up

hoping when it opens i'll see you...
you...

wishing i could go back
wishing i could go back
wishing i could go back
wishing i could go back
to that strangers door
you...
that i'd see you...

hey, hey
oh, oh
see you
baby
baby, oh
see you
i'd see you...
i'd see you...


my heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat,
if you ever need me just tell me and i'll be there
'cause i was build for you
yeah i was build to carry all your feelings
'cause i won't let them know
i won't let you go, baby
i don't care what your past is, i don't need no answers just have faith in me
don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
my heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat
all your worries can be through if you, if you come and see
don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
my heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat
all your worries can be through if you, if you come and see
no need to step back, don't be scared i got you you know that
i'm here and your out side when all your clouds turn back
'cause i won't let you go, baby

oh, baby
oh, baby
oh, we both know the truth
if it were the real me and you
this wouldn't be the right thing to do

now the room is all hazy
we're too lost in the fumes
i feel like it's just me and you
yeah, we got nothing to lose

it's too late to run away from it all
it's too late to get away from it all
i'm done with running, so i give it to you

this moment has caused a reaction
resulting in a reattachment
girl, you take me to nirvana
i don't think this will last
cause you're here in my arms

oh, baby
oh, baby
oh, we both feel the same
i'm not gonna give you my name
and i don't think you want that to change

we're in this together
we don't know who we are
even if it's moving too fast
maybe we should take it too far

it's too late to run away from it all
it's too late to get away from it all
i'm done with running, so i give it to you

this moment has caused a reaction
resulting in a reattachment
girl, you take me to nirvana
i don't think this will last
cause you're here in my arms

well, you take me to nirvana
i don't think this will last
cause you're here in my arms


you know what i mean
it's like walking in the heat all day with no water
it's like waiting for a friend
watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
or losing in an argument
although you're right can't get your thoughts in order

still i refrain
from talking at you, talking on
you know me well
i don't explain

but what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my free will?
wasting all my precious time
oh, the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh, oh i've
i've told you now

you know what i mean
although i try my best i still let down the team
you're everything i want
why should i resist when you are there for me?

should i refrain
from talking at you, talking on
you know me well
i don't explain

but what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my free will?
wasting all my precious time
oh, the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh, oh i've
i've told you now

i've told you now
and i've told you now!
and i've told you now!

still i refrain
from talking at you, talking on
you know me well
i don't explain

so what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my free will?
wasting all my precious time
what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my own will?
wasting all my precious time
oh, the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh, oh i've
i've told you now


you lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
you, you enchant me even when you're not around
if there are boundaries, i will try to knock them down
i'm latching on, babe, now i know what i have found

i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love
i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love

now i've got you in my space
i won't let go of you
got you shackled in my embrace
i'm latching on to you

i'm so enraptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
how do you do it, you got me losing every breath
what did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest

i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love
i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love

now i've got you in my space
i won't let go of you

i'm latching on to you

i'm latching on

i had a dream i was mugged outside your house
i had a dream in a panic you came running out
for a moment you were sure i'd die on you
for a moment i believed you loved me too
but life is never like this, and you're never strong

too much of a good thing won't be good for long
although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
watch where i tread before i fall

we'd talk maybe 20 times a day
and still i never say what i want to say
i thought i wouldn't need to
i guess i read you wrong

too much of a good thing won't be good for long
although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
watch where i tread before i fall

you refuse to see this, don't see it anymore
i have made the decision not to answer your calls
'cause i put everything out there and i got nothing at all

too much of a good thing isn't good and you know
i watch where i walk before i fall
before i fall


but i still need love 'cause i'm just a man
i don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

oh, won't you stay with me?
'cause you're all i need
this ain't love it's clear to see
but darling, stay with me

why am i so emotional?
no it's not a good look, gain some self control
and deep down i know this never works
but you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

oh, won't you stay with me?
'cause you're all i need
this ain't love it's clear to see
but darling, stay with me

oh, won't you stay with me?
'cause you're all i need
this ain't love it's clear to see
but darling, stay with me

oh, won't you stay with me?
'cause you're all i need
this ain't love it's clear to see
but darling, stay with me


i don't have much to give, but i don't care for gold
what use is money, when you need someone to hold
don't have direction i'm just rolling down this road
waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

pack up and leave everything, don't you see what i can bring
can't keep this beating heart at bay
leave your lover, leave him for me

we sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
i'm in love with you and you will never know
but if i can't have you i'll walk this life alone
spare you the rising storms and let the river flow
or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name

pack up and leave everything, don't you see what i can bring
can't keep this beating heart at bay
leave your lover, leave him for me
leave your lover, leave him for me


you and me, we made a vow
for better or for worse
i can't believe you let me down
but the proof's in the way it hurts

for months on end i've had my doubts
denying every tear
i wish this would be over now
but i know that i still need you here

you say i'm crazy
'cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one

you've been so unavailable
now sadly i know why
your heart is unobtainable
even though god knows you have mine

you say i'm crazy
'cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one

i have loved you for many years
maybe i am just not enough
you've made me realize my deepest fear
by lying and tearing us up

you say i'm crazy
'cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one

you say i'm crazy
'cause you don't think i know what you've done
but when you call me baby
i know i'm not the only one
i know i'm not the only one
i know i'm not the only one
and i know, and i know, and i know,
and i know, and i know, and i don't know
i know i'm not the only one


you know what i mean
it's like walking in the heat all day with no water
it's like waiting for a friend
watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
or losing in an argument
although you're right can't get your thoughts in order

still i refrain
from talking at you, talking on
you know me well
i don't explain

but what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my free will?
wasting all my precious time
oh, the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh, oh i've
i've told you now

you know what i mean
although i try my best i still let down the team
you're everything i want
why should i resist when you are there for me?

should i refrain
from talking at you, talking on
you know me well
i don't explain

but what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my free will?
wasting all my precious time
oh, the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh, oh i've
i've told you now

i've told you now
and i've told you now!
and i've told you now!

still i refrain
from talking at you, talking on
you know me well
i don't explain

so what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my free will?
wasting all my precious time
what the hell
why do you think i come 'round here on my own will?
wasting all my precious time
oh, the truth spills out
and oh oh ooh, oh i've
i've told you now


he could be a sinner, or a gentleman
he could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
he could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
he'll never love you like i can, can

he could be a stranger you gave a second glance
he could have your humour that i don't understand 'cause
he'll never love you like i can, can, can

why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
he'll never love you like i can, can, can
he'll never love you like i can, can

a chance encounter of circumstance
maybe he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
he could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
he'll never love you like i can, can, can

why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
he'll never love you like i can, can, can
he'll never love you like i can, can, can
he'll never love you like i can, can, can

we both have demons, that we can't stand
i love your demons, like devils can
if you're still seeking an honest man
and stop deceiving lord please

why are you looking down all the wrong roads
when mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
there may be lovers who hold out their hands but
he'll never love you like i can, can, can
he'll never love you like i can, can, can
he'll never love you like i can, can, can


i've been sleeping with the lights on
'cause the darkness is surrounding you
this is my world, this is my choice
and you're the drug that gets me through

i've been waiting for an answer
because i built this bed for two
i'm just waiting on your answer
i built this bed for me and you

could you see that i am yours?
so will you be my life support?
you're my life support
you're my life support

sick of waking up in darkness
when the sky is always painted blue
there's a method to my madness
it's clear that you don't have a clue

i've been waiting for an answer
because i built this bed for two
i'm just waiting on your answer
i built this bed for me and you

could you see that i am yours?
so will you be my life support?
you're my life support
you're my life support
you're my life support
you're my life support

can't you see that i am yours?
so will you be my life support?
i've been sleeping with the lights on
'cause the darkness is surrounding you


and i hate to say i love you
when it's so hard for me
and i hate to say i want you
when you make it so clear
you don't want me

i'd never ask you cause deep down
i'm certain i know what you'd say
you'd say i'm sorry believe me
i love you but not in that way

and i hate to say i need you
i'm so reliant
i'm so dependant
i'm such a fool

when you're not there
i find myself singing the blues
can't bear
can't face the truth

you will never know that feeling
you will never see through these eyes

i'd never ask you
cause deep down i'm certain i know what you'd say
you'd say i'm sorry
believe me
i love you
but not in that way

you'd say i'm sorry
believe me
i love you
but not in that way


yes i do, i believe
that one day i will be, where i was
right there, right next to you
and it's hard, the days just seem so dark
the moon, the stars, are nothing without you
your touch, your skin, where do i begin?
no words can explain, the way i'm missing you
these tears, they tell their own story

you told me not to cry when you were gone
but the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
can i lay by your side, next to you, you
and make sure you're alright
i'll take care of you

i'm reaching out to you
can you hear my call?
this hurt that i've been through
i'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

can i lay by your side, next to you, you
and make sure you're alright
i'll take care of you

can i lay by your side, next to you, you
and make sure you're alright


don't say it was a good thing
don't say it was the right thing to do
don't say it was the best thing for the both of us
when i'm the one playing the fool

what do you want from me when i just wanna restart
you keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
and the truth is i'm better on my own
and i'm the one to leave it apart
so let me restart
so let me restart
so let me restart

you've been lightin' up my phone
wanna make sure that i'm fine
but baby you're not on my mind, no more
i know it was the best thing for the both of us
'cause you're the one who looks like a fool

what do you want from me when i just wanna restart
you keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
and the truth is i'm better on my own
and i'm the one to leave it apart
so let me restart
so let me restart
so let me restart

so let me restart

what do you want from me when i just wanna restart
you keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
and the truth is i'm better on my own
and i'm the one to leave it apart
so let me restart
so let me restart
so let me restart
so let me restart
so let me restart
hmm


you lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
you, you enchant me even when you're not around
if there are boundaries, i will try to knock them down
i'm latching on, babe, now i know what i have found

i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love
i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love

now i've got you in my space
i won't let go of you
got you shackled in my embrace
i'm latching on to you

i'm so enraptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
how do you do it, you got me losing every breath
what did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest

i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love
i feel we're close enough
could i lock in your love

now i've got you in my space
i won't let go of you
got you shackled in my embrace
i'm latching on to you

now i've got you in my space
i won't let go of you
got you shackled in my embrace
i'm latching on to you

i'm latching on
to you


i've gotta get out of here
this town's no longer fun
and i'm falling closer, falling closer
closer to the sun
i've gotta get out of here
come kiss another face
'cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad
and i don't like the taste

you say it's over, leaving me so far from sober
now summer is colder, i lean on a stranger's shoulder
i walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smoulder
without a trace i'm under

and god knows i try
but each time i do
it only reminds me of you
it only reminds me of you

i've gotta get out of here
'cause you'll never want me back
you are moving on, moving on
and i'm stuck on the track
i've gotta get out of here
before i self-destruct
and i don't want, and i don't want
my heart to ever stop

i walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smolder
without a trace i'm under

and god knows i try
but each time i do
it only reminds me of you
it only reminds me of you

and god knows i try
but each time i do
it only reminds me of you
it only reminds me of you

it only reminds me of you


my mind runs away to you
with the thought i hope you'll see
can't see where it's wandered too
but i know where it wants to be

i'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
i have one vacancy and i wanted you to know that

you're the one designed for me
a distant stranger that i will complete
i know you're out there we're meant to be
so keep your hair down and make it to me
and make it to me

so sick of this lonely air
it seems such a waste of breath
so much that i need to say
so much to get off my chest

i'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
i have one vacancy and i wanted you to know that

you're the one designed for me
a distant stranger that i will complete
i know you're out there we're meant to be
so keep your hair down and make it to me
make it to me
make it to me
make it to me


you must think that i'm stupid
you must think that i'm a fool
you must think that i'm new to this
but i have seen this all before

i'm never gonna let you close to me
even though you mean the most to me
'cause every time i open up, it hurts
so i'm never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt

every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
and every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out, the less i love you
baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

i'm way too good at goodbyes
i'm way too good at goodbyes
no way that you'll see me cry
i'm way to good at goodbyes

i know you're thinking i'm heartless
i know you're thinking i'm cold
i'm just protecting my innocence
i'm just protecting my soul

i'm never gonna let you close to me
even though you mean the most to me
'cause every time i open up, it hurts
so i'm never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt

every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
and every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out, the less i love you
baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

i'm way to good at goodbyes
i'm way too good at goodbyes
no way that you'll see me cry

no way that you'll see me cry
i'm way too good at goodbyes
no
no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no
no, no, no

'cause overtime you hurt me, the less that i cry
and every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out, the less i love you
baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
i'm way too good at goodbyes


i never feel like this
i'm used to emptiness in my heart
and in my arms
you're not what i'm used to
you keep me guessing with things that you do
i hope that they're true

'cause i'm never gonna heal my past
if i run every time it starts
so i need to know if i'm in this alone

come on baby, say it first
i need to hear you say those words
if i'm all that you desire, i promise there'll be fire
i need to hear you say it first
come on baby, do your worst
i know you'll take me higher
so come on darling
if you love me, say it first

say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?
say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?

i know you're right for me
but i'm waiting for everything in your world
to align with my world
i think of you while i sleep
i dream of what we could be if we grow
together unfold

'cause i'm never gonna heal my past
if i run every time it starts
so i need to know if i'm in this alone

come on baby, say it first
i need to hear you say those words
if i'm all that you desire, i promise there'll be fire
i need to hear you say it first
come on baby, do your worst
i know you'll take me higher
so come on darling
if you love me, say it first

say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?
say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?
say it first
say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?
say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?

come on baby, say it first
i need to hear you say those words
if i'm all that you desire, i promise there'll be fire
i need to hear you say it first
come on baby, do your worst
i know you'll take me higher
so come on darling
if you love me, say it first

say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?
say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?
say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?
say it, say it, say it
won't you say it to me?


maybe one day i won't sing about you
i'll sing a song about someone new
but right here, right now, you are on my mind
and i think about you all the time

i'm sending a message to you
and i'm hoping that it will get through

when it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
you made me sad till i loved the shade of blue
i know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what i will do
maybe you're listening, so here's one last song for you
here's one last song for you

and i hope it makes you feel
and i hope it makes you burn
and i hope it reminds you of how much it hurt

i'm sending a message to you
and i'm hoping that it will get through

when it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
you made me sad till i loved the shade of blue
i know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what i will do
maybe you're listening, so here's one last song for you

in case you hear this, then know you're the love of my life
want to tell you i'm sorry, i miss having you by my side
when you were mine

when it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
you made me sad till i loved the shade of blue
i know you don't want to talk to me,
so this is what i will do
maybe you're listening, so here's one last song for you
here's one last song for you


i choose me, and i know that's selfish, love
you are a dream, and i can't thank you enough
but i give another piece of me away
every waking day that i'm with you
am i a monster? what will your family think of me?
they brought me in, they helped me out with everything
but i give a little piece of me away
every single day

i got my reasons, but darling i can't explain
i'll always love you
bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

love you so much that i have to let you go
i'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
but it would be wrong for me to stay
and i'll just give you hope

i got my reasons, but darling i can't explain
i'll always love you
i can't stop crying, i hate that i've caused you pain
but i can't deny it, i just don't feel the same
i'll always love you
bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
i got my reasons, but darling i can't explain
i'll always love you


i've been burning
yes, i've been burning
such a burden
this flame on my chest
no insurance to pay for the damage
yeah, i've been burning up since you left

i've been smoking, oh
more than twenty a day
blame it on rebellion
don't blame it on me
wish i was younger
back to the nineteenth of may
i had an open mind
swore to never change

funny how time goes by
had respect for myself
that river ran dry
you reached a limit
i wasn't enough
it's like the fire replaced all the love

i've been burning
yes, i've been burning
such a burden
this flame on my chest
no insurance to pay for the damage
yeah, i've been burning up since you left

oh, have you ever called
i will burst straight back
give you my forgiveness
and the shirt off my back
no friends to turn to
yeah, i messed up that
wish we could smoke again
just for a day, oh

funny how time goes by
had respect for myself
that river ran dry
you reached a limit
i wasn't enough
and it's like the fire replaced all the love

i've been burning
yes, i've been burning
such a burden
this flame on my chest
no insurance to pay for the damage
yeah, i've been burning up since you left

yeah, i've been burning up since you left
oh, i've been burning up since you left


holy father, we need to talk
i have a secret, that i can't keep
i'm not the boy that, you thought you wanted
please don't get angry, have faith in me

say i shouldn't be here but i can't give up his touch
it is him i love, it is him
don't you try and tell me that god doesn't care for us
it is him i love, it is him i love

i walk the streets of mississippi
i hold my lover by the hand
i feel you staring when he is with me
how can i make you understand?

say i shouldn't be here but i can't give up his touch
it is him i love, it is him
don't you try and tell me that god doesn't care for us
it is him i love, it is him i love

oh, oh
oh, i love
oh, oh
no, no, i love
oh, oh
i love
oh, oh
oh, oh
him i love
oh, oh
him i love
oh, oh
him i love
oh, oh
him i love

holy father, judge my sins
i'm not afraid of what they will bring
i'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
i love him


you say that you're leaving, but i don't think i can let go
when you put the phone down, i began to cry
what are you to do, when the person that you love just says no?
boy, get yourself together, move on with your life

so i'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
got to get you out my system
i would do anything to keep you off my mind
when i gonna have to call my sisters
be around the ones who listen

baby, you make me crazy
why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
save me, make it all hazy
so i don't think about you till tomorrow

it wasn't enough, but you could've had the guts to face me
it would have meant so much, if you'd looked me in the eye
why do i always fall for the ones who have no courage?
i must see some kind of beauty in their eyes

so i'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
got to get you out my system
i would do anything to keep you off my mind
i'm gonna have to call my sisters
be around the ones who listen

baby, you make me crazy
why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
save me, make it all hazy
so i don't think about you till tomorrow

baby, you make me crazy
why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
save me, make it all hazy
so i don't think about you till tomorrow

baby, you make me crazy
why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
save me, make it all hazy
so i don't think about you till tomorrow


i see you in the morning, feel your fingers in my hair
sometimes i still pretend you're all there
it hits me without warning, your reflection walking by
but i know it's only in my mind

will you show me the piece of my heart i've been missing?
won't you give me the part of myself that i can't get back?
will you show me the piece of my heart i've been missing?
'cause i'd kill for you, and darling you know that

so i'll light up a cigarette
i'll drink it down till there's nothing left
'cause i sure can't get no sleep
and lord knows there's no relief

you held my heart in your fingertips
so now i drown in my bitterness
oh, i can't get no sleep
and i sure won't, i sure won't find no peace
no peace

all that i am asking is for a little clarity
that's all that really matters to me
in and out of focus, tears are in my eyes
we're burning down the bridges this time

will you show me the piece of my heart i've been missing?
won't you give me the part of myself that i can't give back?
will you show me the piece of my heart i've been missing?
'cause i'd kill for you, and darling you know that

so i'll light up a cigarette
i'll drink it down till there's nothing left
'cause i sure can't get no sleep
and lord knows there's no relief

you held my heart in your fingertips
so now i drown in my bitterness
oh, i can't get no sleep
and i sure won't, i sure won't find

i used to find comfort in your arms
caught up in the wonder of your charms
oh, i'll cry for you, i'll cry for you
i'll lie for you, i'll lie for you
but i don't even know you anymore

so i'll light up a cigarette
i'll drink it down till there's nothing left
'cause i sure can't get no sleep
and lord knows there's no relief

you held my heart in your fingertips
so now i drown in my bitterness
oh, i can't get no sleep
and i sure won't, i sure won't find no peace

sure won't find no peace, no
will you give me the piece
will you give me the piece of my heart?
will you give me the piece
will you give me the piece of my heart?


now i'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
that's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
see me lose focus, as i sing to you loud
and i can't, no, i won't hush
i'll say the words that make you blush
i'm gonna sing this now

see, i'm true, my songs are where my heart is
i'm like glue, i stick to other artists
i'm not you, now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see, i'm real, i do it all, it's all me
i'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
i won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me

i sing and write my own tune
and i write my own verse? hell
don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell?
call yourself a singer-writer. you're just bluffing
your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
i will blast and i didn't go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act, right
i can't last if i'm smoking on a crack pipe

and i won't be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia
and musically i'm demonstrating
when i perform live, feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
"a young singer-writer like gabriella cilmi"

'cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me

'cause with the lyrics i'll be aiming it right
i won't stop till my name's in light
at stadium heights with damien rice
because i'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
never be anything but a singer-songwriter
the games over but now i'm on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal

people think that i'm bound to blow up
i've done around about a thousand shows
but i haven't got a house plus i live on the couch

from day one, i've been prepared
with vo5 wax for my ginger hair
so now i'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'cause it's another day
plus i'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rappers shoes using new laces
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide till we're just jack, soon as i get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows, if i'm not i'm in the studio
truly broke, never growing up call me *ruffio
melody music maker
reading all the papers

cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you


filled up with doubt
i have to move home
but i want to stay with you
for all of the summer
i have my plan
that you won't remember
if you want to see the world
then please ask your mother
i cannot hold your hand
to watch you go
i am a liar
as you might know
i need you now
i need your touch
and your lips
i need that smile
and your kiss

you're so cool
you're so beautiful
you're so
you're so

i see your grace
from my window
it'll show me your shadow
i'm in my place
hope you remember
when summer's gone
i'll still sing a song
of you in september
i cannot hold your hand
to watch you go
i am a liar
as you might know
i need you now
i need your touch
and your lips
i need that smile
and your kiss

you're so cool
you're so beautiful
you're so
you're so

these words i say mean
you're so amazing
i've noticed lately
i need you, maybe

you're so cool
you're so beautiful
you're so
you're so


unhappy days
that left us on the floor
and you'd breathe me
'til you're not feeling sure
everything will brighten up
if we go to brighton i'll take you along the pier
everything will lighten up
if you feel too frightened i'll make it disappear

darling don't be nervous
i'll understand if you let me go
i did this on purpose now

when i'm missing you
i'll stop eating food
and i'll squeeze in to a dress so i can be like you
and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you're leaving too
maybe i'll put you to a test and say that i love you
i think that i love you

sunny days
that left my skin blood red
and you squeeze me
'til these thoughts leave my head
if it gets too complicated
i'll give up and be frustrated
can you see what's wrong?
if you feel like you've been hated
this loves too overrated
see what's going on, on

darling don't be nervous
i'll understand if you let me go
i did this on purpose now

when i'm missing you
i'll stop eating food
and i'll squeeze in to a dress so i can be like you
and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you're leaving too
maybe i'll put you to a test and say that i love you
i think that i love you

take me back to live at home
take me back to albert road
now i'm missing you
i've stopped eating food
and i've squeezed in to your dress so i can feel like you
but then i saw your bitterness and why you left me too
i thought i'll put you to a test and say that i love you
i think that i love you

and i've stopped eating food
and i've squeezed in to your dress
so i could feel like you
but then i saw your bitterness
and why you left me too
maybe i'll put you to a test and say that i love you
now it seems you loved me too


this city never sleeps
i hear the people walk by when it's late
sirens beat through my windowsill
i can't close my eyes
don't control what i'm into

and this tower is alive
with lights that are blinding me awake
hood up and lace untied
the sleep fills my mind
can't control what i'm into

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in the back seat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

the pavement is my friend
it will take me where i need to go
i find it trips me up
and puts me down
this is not what i'm used to

and the shop across the road
fills my needs and gives me company
when i need it
voices beat through my walls
i don't think i'm gonna make it
past tomorrow

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in a back seat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

and my lungs hurt
and my ears bled
with the sounds of the city life
echoed in my head
do i need this
to keep me alive
the traffic stops and starts
but i need to move alone

london calls me a stranger
this is not my home
home

i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in a back seat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two


you're not her
though i try to see you differently
i tow the line
see, i'm searching for what used to be mine

i saw your eyes and then i saw alice staring back at me
and i will try to find another one who's suited to me
as well as her

i've moved far away from you and i want to see you here
beside me, dear, but things aren't clear

when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you
i miss you

she was mine, i was hers and all that's in between
when she would cry, i would shelter her and keep her
from the darkness that will be

if i moved far away from you and i want to see you here
beside me, dear, but things aren't clear, woah

when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you
and i miss you

don't drop me in, it's not my turn
if you cut deep then i might learn
if you scar and leave me like sunburn

don't drop me in, it's not my time
if you cut deep then i might learn
you scarred and left me, like sunburn

when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you
and i miss you


you and i
two of a mind
this love's
one of a kind
you and i
we're drifting
over the edge
and i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you
would you fall too?

you and i
learning to speak
with kisses on cheek
we're lifted
over the edge
and i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you
would you fall too?

i will fall for you
and i will fall for you
if i fall for you


the rain wont stop falling
it's harder than before
this car keeps on stalling
pedal to the floor

what i need to know
is if you love me and i
really need to know
is if you want me when you call
if you want me when you call

we were young and we were foolish
school books in our arms
dodging homework, dodging classes
to set off fire alarms

and what i need to know
is if you love me and i
really need to know
if you need me when you call
if you want me when you call

we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away
we are waving our lives away


what i need to know
is if you love me and i
really need to know
if you need me when you call
if you want me when you call


and i will lie with you
i start to feel those butterflies
when i'm next to you

tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you?
do i hate you?
i can't make up my mind
so let's freefall
see where we land

it's been this way since we were young
we'll fight and then make up
i'll breathe your air into my lungs
when i feel your touch

tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you?
do i hate you?
i can't make up my mind
so let's freefall


she's like cold coffee in the morning
she'll make me shiver without warning
and make me laugh as if i'm in on the joke

and you can stay with me forever
or you could stay with me for now

tell me if i'm wrong
tell me if i'm right
tell me if you need a loving hand
tell me if i know
tell me if i do
tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

i'll wake with coffee in the morning
but she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
outside the day is up and calling
but i don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

stay with me forever
or you could stay with me for now

tell me if i'm wrong

tell me if i'm right
tell me if you need a loving hand
tell me if i know
tell me if i do
tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

'cause i love the way you wake me up
for goodness sake will my love not be enough?

tell me if i'm wrong
tell me if i'm right
tell me if you need a loving hand
tell me if i know
tell me if i do
tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

tell me if i'm wrong
tell me if i'm right
tell me if you need a loving hand


i paid all my dues
and she wanted to know
that i'd never leave her
now i'm ready to go
as strange as it seems
she's endless to me
she's just like paperwork but harder to read

patience's my enemy
loving's my friend
it's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend

oh she, knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself

i made all my plans
and as she has made hers
she kept me in mind
but i wasn't sure
i searched every room
for a way to escape
but every time i try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight
and blocking my way

patience's my enemy

loving's my friend
it's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend

oh she, knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself

and like the back of her hand she already understands everything
"won't you stay" she says
and she already knows how it goes
and where she stands i'll stay, anyway

'cause she knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself
oh she, knows me so well
oh she, knows me like i know myself
i know myself

oh she, knows me like i know myself
i know myself
i know myself
i know myself


ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh

i am a poor wayfaring stranger
travelling through, this world alone
there's no sickness, toil or danger
and that bright laight to which i go
and i'm going there to see my mother
and i'm going there no more to roam
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going over home now

hey-ey yeah
ooh

i know dark clouds will gather me
i know my way's rough and steep
and the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
and i know my way's rough and steep
i'm going there to see my mother
i'm going there no more to roam
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going over home now

'cause i am a poor wayfaring stranger
travelling through, this world alone
there's no sickness, toil or danger
and that bright laight to which i go
i'm going there to see my mother
i'm going there no more to roam
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going home now


i found your hairband on my bedroom floor
the only evidence that you've been 'ere before
and i don't get waves of missing you anymore
they're more like tsunami tides in my eyes

never getting dry, so i get high
smoke in the day then i sleep with the light on
weeks pass in the blink of an eye

i don't drink like everybody else
end up forgetting things about myself
i stumble and fall with the head spin i've got
my mind's with you but my heart's just not

so am i close to you anymore, now it's over
and there's no chance that we'll work it out
that's why you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied

everybody said that we'll be together forever
but i know that i never wanna settle down
come around, break up the love like lego now
never wanna turn into another like you

sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
everything's great but everything's short
but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus
now i'm in position to be another stalker
and everything i say seems to always sound awkward

like our last kiss, it was perfect
but we were nervous on the surface
and i'm always saying every day that it was worth it
pain is only relevant if it still hurts
i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
and go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

so am i close to you anymore, now it's over
and there's no chance that we'll work it out
oh, you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied

because if i was gonna go somewhere, i'd be there by now
and maybe i can let myself down, oh
and i'm thinking that i am unaware, i keep my feet on the ground
i keep looking around, to make sure i'm not
the only one to feel low

because if you want, i'll take you in my arms
and keep you sheltered from all that i've done wrong
and i know you'll say that i'm the only one
but i know god made another one of me
to love you better than i ever will

'cause you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied


now i'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
that's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
see me lose focus, as i sing to you loud
and i can't, no, i won't hush
i'll say the words that make you blush
i'm gonna sing this now

see, i'm true, my songs are where my heart is
i'm like glue, i stick to other artists
i'm not you, now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see, i'm real, i do it all, it's all me
i'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
i won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you

because i'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
never be anything but a singer-songwriter
the games over but now i'm on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal

people think that i'm bound to blow up
i've done around about a thousand shows
but i haven't got a house plus i live on the couch

from day one, i've been prepared
with vo5 wax for my ginger hair
so now i'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'cause it's another day
plus i'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rappers shoes using new laces
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide till we're just jack, soon as i get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows, if i'm not i'm in the studio
truly broke, never growing up call me ruffio
melody music maker
reading all the papers

cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you


white lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
burnt lungs, sour taste
light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent

and they say she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
but lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
crumbling like pastries, they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

'cause we're just under the upperhand
and go mad for a couple grams

and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
it's too cold outside for angels to fly
angels to fly

ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
dry house, wet clothes
loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
call girl, no phone

and they say she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
but lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
crumbling like pastries, they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

'cause we're just under the upperhand
and go mad for a couple grams

and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
sells love to another man
it's too cold outside for angels to fly

an angel will die, covered in white
closed eye and hoping for a better life
straight down the line

and they say she's in the class a team
stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
but lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
crumbling like pastries, they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

and we're all under the upper hand
go mad for a couple grams

in a pipe, fly to the motherland
or sell love to another man
it's too cold outside for angels to fly
angels to fly

to fly, fly
for angels to fly
to fly, to fly
angels to die


i wanna be drunk when i wake up
on the right side of the wrong bed
and never an excuse that i made up
tell you the truth that i want
didn't kill me. it never made me stronger at all

love will scare your makeup
lip sticks to me, so now i maybe lean back there
i'm sat here wishing i was sober
and no, i'll never hold you like i used to

but the house gets cold when you cut the heating
without you to hold i'll be freezing
can't rely on the heart to beating
'cause you take part of it every evening
take words out of my mouth just from breathing
replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'

should i?, should i?
maybe i'll get drunk again
i'll be drunk again
i'll be drunk again
to feel a little love

i wanna hold your heart in both hands
not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
and i got no plans for the weekend
so should we speak then? keep it between friends
though i know you'll never love me like you used to

there maybe other people like us
who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
and you don't hold me anymore

on cold days cold plays out like the band's name
i know i can't heal things with a handshake
you know i can change, as i began saying
you cut me wide open like landscape
open bottles of beer but never champagne
to applaud you with the sound that my hands make

should i?, should i?
maybe i'll get drunk again
i'll be drunk again
i'll be drunk again
to feel a little love

all by myself, i'm here again
all by myself, you know i'll never change
all by myself
all by myself

i'm just drunk again
i'll be drunk again
i'll be drunk again
to feel a little love


i found your hairband on my bedroom floor
the only evidence that you've been 'ere before
and i don't get waves of missing you anymore
they're more like tsunami tides in my eyes

never getting dry, so i get high
smoke in the day then i sleep with the light on
weeks pass in the blink of an eye

i don't drink like everybody else
end up forgetting things about myself
i stumble and fall with the head spin i've got
my mind's with you but my heart's just not

so am i close to you anymore, now it's over
and there's no chance that we'll work it out
that's why you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied

everybody said that we'll be together forever
but i know that i never wanna settle down
come around, break up the love like lego now
never wanna turn into another like you

sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
everything's great but everything's short
but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus
now i'm in position to be another stalker
and everything i say seems to always sound awkward

like our last kiss, it was perfect
but we were nervous on the surface
and i'm always saying every day that it was worth it
pain is only relevant if it still hurts
i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
and go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

so am i close to you anymore, now it's over
and there's no chance that we'll work it out
oh, you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied

because if i was gonna go somewhere, i'd be there by now
and maybe i can let myself down, oh
and i'm thinking that i am unaware, i keep my feet on the ground
i keep looking around, to make sure i'm not
the only one to feel low

because if you want, i'll take you in my arms
and keep you sheltered from all that i've done wrong
and i know you'll say that i'm the only one
but i know god made another one of me
to love you better than i ever will

'cause you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows i lied


my mind is a warrior
my heart is a foreigner
my eyes are the colour of red like a sunset
i'll never keep it bottled up
and left to the hands of the coroner
be a true heart not a follower
we're not done yet

and if we should ever do this right
i'm never gonna let you down
i'll never let you down
we'll keep it on the down-low
and i'll keep you around so i'll know
that i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down

you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but i've never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but i've never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down now

my eyes are a river filler
this drink is a liver killer
my chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again
your body is my ballpoint pen
and your mind is my new best friend
your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again

and if we should ever do this right
i'm never gonna let you down
i'll never let you down
i'll keep it on the down-low
and i'll keep you around so i'll know
that i'll never let you down
i'll never let you down

you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but i've never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but i've never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and i'll never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and i'll never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and i'll never let you down
hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and i'll never let you down

you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but i've never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but i've never felt this way
i'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down


i should ink my skin with your name
and take my passport out again
and just replace it
see i could do without a tan
on my left hand,
where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
and i should run you a hot bath
fill it up with bubbles

'cause maybe you're loveable
maybe you're my snowflake
and your eyes turn from green to gray
and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place
and you should never cut your hair
'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder

and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe i'm just in love
when you wake me up

and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
could you make me a cup of tea
to open my eyes in the right way
and i know you love shrek
because we've watched it 12 times
and maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
and if your dvd breaks today
you should've got a vcr
because i've never owned a blue ray, true say

because your brother always beats me
and if i lost, i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv
and then you laugh at me
and be asking me
if i'ma be home next week
and then you lie with me till i fall asleep
and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe i'm just in love
when you wake me up

and i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try to get me to stop
but you drink as much as me
and i get drunk a lot
so i take you to the beach
and walk along the sand
and i'll make you a heart pendant
with a pebble held in my hand
and i'll carve it like this necklace
so the heart falls where your chest is
now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
and it falls just where it needs to be
and rests peacefully
so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
against yours now
maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
maybe i fell in love when you woke me up


you're just a small bump unborn
in four months you're brought to life
you might be left with my hair
but you'll have your mother's eyes

i'll hold your body in my hands
be as gentle as i can
but for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
a small bump, in four months you're brought to life

and i'll whisper quietly
and give you nothing but truth
if you're not inside me
i'll put my future in you

you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'round my thumb and hold me tight
you are my one and only, you can wrap your fingers
'round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

you're just a small bump unknown
you'll grow into your skin
with a smile like hers
and a dimple beneath your chin

fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
and eyelids closed to be soon open wide
a small bump, in four months
you'll open your eyes

and i'll hold you tightly
and tell you nothing but truth
if you're not inside me
i'll put my future in you

you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet
when you're half asleep i'll leave you be
right in front of me, for a couple weeks
so i could keep you safe

'cause you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers
'round my thumb and hold me tight
you are my one and only you can wrap your fingers
'round my thumb and hold me tight, and you'll be alright

'cause you were just a small bump unborn
for four months, then torn from life
maybe you were needed up there
but we're still unaware as why


this is the start of something beautiful
this is the start of something new
you are the one that made me lose it all
you are the the start of something new

and i'll throw it all away
watched you fall into my arms again
and i'll throw it all away
watch you fall, now

you are the earth i will stand on
you are the words i will sing

and i'd thrown it all away
watched you fall into his arms again
and i'd thrown it all away
watched you fall, now

and take me back
and take me home
watch me fall, down to earth
take me back home

this is the start of something beautiful
you are the start of something new


this city never sleeps
i hear the people walk by when it's late
sirens beat through my windowsill
i can't close my eyes
don't control what i'm into

and this tower is alive
with lights that are blinding me awake
hood up and lace untied
the sleep fills my mind
can't control what i'm into

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in the back seat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

the pavement is my friend
it will take me where i need to go
i find it trips me up
and puts me down
this is not what i'm used to

and the shop across the road
fills my needs and gives me company
when i need it
voices beat through my walls
i don't think i'm gonna make it
past tomorrow

london calls me a stranger
a traveller
this is now my home
my home

i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in a back seat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two

and my lungs hurt
and my ears bled
with the sounds of the city life
echoed in my head
do i need this
to keep me alive
the traffic stops and starts
but i need to move alone

london calls me a stranger
this is not my home
home

i'm burning on the back street
stuck here, sitting in a back seat
i'm blazing on the street
what i do isn't up to you
if the city never sleeps
then that makes two


i'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a lego house
if things go wrong, we can knock it down
my three words have two meanings
but there's one thing on my mind, it's all for you

and it's dark in a cold december
but i've got ya to keep me warm
if you're broken, i will mend ya and i'll keep you
sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now

i'm out of sight, i'm out of mind
i'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now, now

i'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
if things go right, we can frame it and put you on a wall
and it's so hard to say it but i've been here before
now i'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now

i'm out of sight, i'm out of mind
i'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now

don't hold me down
i think my braces are breaking
and it's more than i can take

and it's a dark and cold december
but i've got ya to keep me warm
if you're broken, i will mend ya and i'll keep you
sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now

i'm out of sight, i'm out of mind
i'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i've done
i think i love you better now

i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i will love you better now


now i'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
that's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
see me lose focus, as i sing to you loud
and i can't, no, i won't hush
i'll say the words that make you blush
i'm gonna sing this now

see, i'm true, my songs are where my heart is
i'm like glue, i stick to other artists
i'm not you, now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see, i'm real, i do it all, it's all me
i'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
i won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me

i sing and write my own tune
and i write my own verse? hell
don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
call yourself a singer-writer. you're just bluffing
your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
i will blast and i didn't go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act, right
i can't last if i'm smoking on a crack pipe

and i won't be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia
and musically i'm demonstrating
when i perform live, feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
"a young singer-writer like gabriella cilmi"

'cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me

'cause with the lyrics i'll be aiming it right
i won't stop till my name's in light
at stadium heights with damien rice
because i'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
never be anything but a singer-songwriter
the games over but now i'm on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal

people think that i'm bound to blow up
i've done around about a thousand shows
but i haven't got a house plus i live on the couch

from day one, i've been prepared
with vo5 wax for my ginger hair
so now i'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'cause it's another day
plus i'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rappers shoes using new laces
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide till we're just jack, soon as i get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows, if i'm not i'm in the studio

give me love like her
'cause lately i've been waking up alone
paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
told you i'd let them go

and that i'll fight my corner
after my blood turns into alcohol
no, i just wanna hold ya

give a little time to me or burn this out
we'll play hide and seek to turn this around
all i want is the taste that your lips allow
my, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
my, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love
my, my-y, my, my-y, give me love

give me love like never before
'cause lately i've been craving more
and it's been a while but i still feel the same
maybe i should let you go

you know i'll fight my corner
after my blood is drowning in alcohol
no, i just wanna hold ya

give a little time to me or burn this out
we'll play hide and seek to turn this around
all i want is the taste that your lips allow
my, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love

give a little time to me or burn this out
we'll play hide and seek to turn this around
all i want is the taste that your lips allow
my, my-y, my, my-y, oh, give me love

another day another life
passes by just like mine
it's not complicated

another mind
another soul
another body to grow old
it's not complicated

do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

another tear
another cry
another place for us to die
it's not complicated

another life that's gone to waste
another light lost from your face
it's complicated

is it only wonder or do birds still sing for you?
float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

ooh how i miss you
my symphony places the song that carries you out
ooh how i miss you
i miss you and i wish you'd stay

is it any wonder that the stars shine out for you?
float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

float down
like autumn leaves
hush now
close your eyes before the sleep
and your miles away
and yesterday you were here with me

ooh oh, ooh oh
ooh oh, ooh oh

touch down
like a seven four seven
stay out and we'll live forever now


if we take this bird in, with its broken leg
we could nurse it, she said
come in side for a little lie down with me
and if we fall asleep it would be the worst thing.
but when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
and tell me if i lie down, would you stay now?
let me hold ya, oh

but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
and it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
and i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

my little bird

if we take a walk out, in the morning dew
we can lay down, so i'm next you
come inside for a little home made tea
and if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
and if i wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
i'm covered by nature and i'm safe now
underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
and it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.

and i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

my little bird

my little bird

my little bird

and of all this thing i'm sure of, i'm not quite certain of your love
you made scream but then i made you cry when i left that little bird with its broken leg to die

but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
and it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
but i'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

my little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa

my little bird

my little bird

you're my little bird...


i woke up wipe the sleep out of my eye,
she left a note "i'll be back in five",
well i'm still waiting for that moment to arrive,

and i was told to put my job in front of you,
but it won't hold me like you do.

but i do it for the love,
waiting on the gold rush,
keep it on the edge,
smoking on a roll-up,
when i see my friends,
all they say is "hold up,
ed, remember the time,
when we were in school,
listening to grown-ups,
didn't learn a thing,
but then again you know what,
you know how to sing,
but you don't know anything other than that,
so maybe you should learn to love her,
like, like the way,
and maybe you should learn to love her,
like, like the way,
and maybe you should learn to love her,
like, like the way,
and maybe you should learn to love her,
like, like the way you wanna be loved."

i never told her that i liked,
the way she dances, slightly out of time,
and pretends she knows the words,
to a song she never heard,
but i tell her all the time,

well, i was told to put my job in front of you,
but it won't hold me like you do.


you're not her
though i try to see you differently
i tow the line
see, i'm searching for what used to be mine

i saw your eyes and then i saw alice staring back at me
and i will try to find another one who's suited to me
as well as her

i've moved far away from you and i want to see you here
beside me, dear, but things aren't clear

when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you
i miss you

she was mine, i was hers and all that's in between
when she would cry, i would shelter her and keep her
from the darkness that will be

if i moved far away from you and i want to see you here
beside me, dear, but things aren't clear, woah

when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you
and i miss you

don't drop me in, it's not my turn
if you cut deep then i might learn
if you scar and leave me like sunburn

don't drop me in, it's not my time
if you cut deep then i might learn
you scarred and left me, like sunburn

when we never even tried, we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful, whenever i was away
i'd miss you
and i miss you


you give me life
like lots of oxygen
you treat me like
i was in love again
and i hold you tight
tight enough to know
that you are mine
i'd never let you go

and it's you i miss
and it's you i miss
so let it out
let it out, now
i let it out
i let it out now, now

you speak me to me
behind your darkening stare
and you let me be
as if i wasn't there
it seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
another couple based on teen sex
you idiot, true i was just like you
we couldn't be torn apart
you see we were just like glue

it's you i miss

and it's you i miss
so let it out
let it out, now
i let it out
i let it out, now, now.

it seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
another couple based on teen sex
you idiot, true i was just like you
we couldn't be torn part
you see we were just like glue

we're like glue

so let it out
let it out, now
let it out
let it out, now, now

it seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
another couple based on teen sex
you idiot, true i was just like you
we couldn't be torn apart
you see we were just like glue


the crowd was getting old

but we've got nothing here
except a tired set of ears and we say

hey mama, i'm something

'cause this is soap disco, so charming
see the floor from a cleaner point of view

the children had the time
to overthrow the slime

bright lights and clean colors

i have told
all of my enemies
very politely
to go home.
i have seen
all of your remedies
now won't you let me please go home.

i can't find anything to be sad about.
they say i'm doomed but i feel fine.

i have tried
so very hard as hell
to stay away from hell
and live upstairs.
when i see
all of your remedies
i try quite desperately to go home.

i can't find anything to be sad about.
they say i'm doomed but i feel fine.
but if i'm sitting here lonely,
with no one to hold me,
at least i'll have my health.
i'm tryin' to control myself.

i have told
all of my enemies
very politely
to go home.
i have seen
all of your remedies
now won't you let me please go home.

i've been acting irresponsibly
oh what could possibly go wrong.
i have choked on all your remedies
now won't you let me please go home.

but if i'm sitting here lonely,
with no one to hold me,
at least i'll have my health
i'm trying to control myself.
i'm trying to control myself.


and the muggers that day

several million lovers
of that dress that's in the window display
and every day they'd say

oliver
oliver
oliver
oliver don't stay

she was quite a woman
quite an understanding woman she was

sure i really loved her
but she acted like a mother to me
and she loved me and i'd scream

nancy
nancy
nancy
please take care of me

oliver, oliver
oliver, oliver
oliver

ah

i was overblown by all the card sharks
and the muggers that day

several million lovers
of that dress that's in the window display
and every day they'd say

oliver
oliver
oliver
oliver don't stay


the family life it was divine
she sat alone with tired eyes
patiently listening to the sighs

i found out
i found out
she never has the time
i found out
to make his demons

they snatched her willingly she left
they wondered why she'd accepted that
she knew that she'd be saved but how
she knew that future kid was on the prowl

i found out
i found out
we could both run wild
i found out
me and future's child

i found out
i found out
we could both run wild
i found out
me and future's child
i found out
never's far too long
for me to sing this song


save our lives...
can't revive...
your magic place is nearing hell...

set it straight
can't relate
i hope your friends treat you well.

all the waiting
caring fading
and i'm fallin'
i'm fallin'

all the waiting
caring fading
and i'm fallin'
i'm fallin'

you saved our lives
and took our knives
you waited for the time to sell.

all the waiting
caring fading
and i'm fallin'
i'm fallin'

save our lives...
can't revive...
your magic place is nearing hell...

set it straight
can't relate
i hope your friends treat you well.

all the waiting
caring fading
and i'm fallin'
i'm fallin'


save our lives...

see my dear i'm thinking of you
my how she has grown
her building blocks have all gone home
and being there is always where
i'll be
you'll see

take your doll
house dreams and make them real
i've seen the sun
i'll guide your
inspirations along
and don't let them stop you from being someone's friend
don't bend

i hope you
always keep your hand this close to mine
and i hope you
never hesitate to wonder why
wonder why
wonder why
if you need a shoulder mine is here
and i love you
and no one can tell you what to do
and roses and diamonds could never take
the place
of your face
i hope you
never hesitate to wonder why
wonder why
wonder why


we filled the day with careless displays
going sailing with nothing to say
when i fell
we could tell

now you're torn apart
the sun's driving fast
taking photographs
it's morning at last
and the sailors are taking a stand
with their heads buried deep in the sand

feeling well
life is swell
when i fell
we could tell
hooray
when i fell
we could tell
feeling well
life is swell


your wind blows
your mind falls down
just give me
the time to drown

your wind blows
your mind falls down
just give me
the time to drown

the boys are
digging the ground
but i can't stop spinning around

one day you will let me be
what i wanted you to be

the boys are
stopping the ground
from taking
those things we found
someday you will let me see
all of the things we used to see

someday you will let me be
all of the things we used to be
someday you will let me be
the champ you wanted her to see


i once heard captain dan tell me a story
about this lovely girl who's name was jane
she was vast and deep and filled with glory

ah

bottom served as home for hull and anchor
she's always fit to quarrel with the wind
the great titanic yes it's she that sank her

ah

then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear

i love you
my ocean blue
i like the way your sea sees me
my darling jane
she speaks to me at times through falling rain

now twas time to manifest her vigor
was she fit to quarrel with the wind?
the air was strong but jane she was much bigger

ah

then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear

i love you
my ocean blue
i like the way your sea sees me
my darling jane
oh me, my darling jane
oh me and my darling jane
she speaks to me at times through falling rain
speaks to me at times through falling rain


nobody cares
about ocean affairs
he's by himself 'cause nobody loves him
cleaning his sand
filled boots with his hand
looking for something but nothing sees him

happy was he
in spite of his knee
that wasn't there because of his day job
there was a man
who took to the band
paying attention tried to adhere him

and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled finding a plan

seemingly fine
he slipped on his wine
terra was healthy but not on a mission

there was a sea
a mythical tease
our cannons were shot
"till we couldn't afford them

others would have died alone
angels all worked free
timeless fairs and sing-alongs
speaking naturally

and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
all the way
from the bay
i could hear them say
all the time
we were dead
and i'm cap' splendid

and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
all the way
from the bay
i could hear them say
i don't care
if we're dead
and i'm cap splendid


have you seen buddy two shoes wilson
he comes around 'bout everyday
if you just sit on down and listen
you'd figure out what i'm trying to say

have you seen buddy two shoes wilson
he comes around 'bout everyday

i wake up
thoughts of you
tattooed to my mind
as i wonder
what to wear
what to eat
who to be
will i see you again

and as my car breaks down
i shake my head and say
what a day

if you only knew
what i went through just to get to you
i'm hanging from you
and i'll hold on if you want me to

every bus, every train,
ever cab, every lane is jammed
so i look to the sky
and i reach for the planes with my hands

if all my days go wrong
it went right

if you only knew
what i went through just to get to you
i'm hanging from you
and i'll hold on if you want me to

if you only knew
what i went through just to get to you
i'm swinging from you
and there's nothing i would rather do


here in this town they have all got the blues
as the paperboy takes off without any news
angels have wings you can feel free to use
the corner store drugs you can freely abuse

and i'm yelling and screaming cause
baby you're driving me crazy

so life on your own has been vacant and cold
everyone's getting somewhere and you're getting old
career opportunities, they all have been sold
along with your body, and most of your soul

and i'm yelling and screaming cause
baby you're driving me crazy

if i could spare more remorse
from my emptied out pores
i would maybe

cause the fog's getting thicker
and the world's spinning fast
the chaos is building
it's going to last
and it's so hard to see
and you're so hard to find
they're days when i think i am losing my mind

so keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes
striking the canvas with deep blues and greens
realists are frowning, they think you're obscene
as you work overtime to make sure they can dream

and i'm yelling and screaming cause
baby you're driving me crazy

if i could spare more remorse
from my emptied out pores
i would maybe

cause the fog's getting thicker
and the world's spinning fast
the chaos is building
it's going to last
and it's so hard to see
and you're so hard to find
they're days when i think i am losing my mind

and we yell
and we scream

as the fog's getting thicker
the world's spinning fast
the chaos is building
it's going to last
and it's so hard to see
and you're so hard to find
they're days when i think i am losing my mind

and the fog's getting thicker
the world's spinning fast
the chaos is building
it's going to last
and it's so hard to see
and you're so hard to find
there's days when i think i am losing my mind


leaning on a tree trunk
thinking all the same junk
fallin' in and out of a dream

back and forth i'm swaying
i'm contemplating staying
laying and decaying when i know i must leave

where do i aim when i shoot the breeze
how do i call myself at times like these

i need a simple kind of lovely
the thought is just a novelty

you can spend the whole time
standin underneath you when they cut you free

what about when the sun leaves
and what about all those bad dreams
who will walk you back into reality

i wish this could be like this everyday
but i know that i could never live this way
was just a simple kind of lovely
the memories will be okay

i wish things could be like this everyday
but i know i could never live this way
was just a simple kind of lovely
and the memories will be okay

was jus a simle kind of lovely
and the memories will be okay


as we kicked around downtown waiting for the sun to rise
we watched the clouds
take the shape of a chevrolet
and the way that i'm feeling is the color of my lover's eyes
she caught me lookin' the other way
thinkin' finally of our better days

as she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
don't know how long we'll be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
and we'll be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck

trippin' on a flat tire
dial up the triple a
time is running out for our escape
so much for that chevrolet
eyes shut tight as we venture to another place
as we listen to the music play
i can't remember what i had to say

as she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
don't know how long we'll be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
and we'll be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck

as she climbs her way
up to the top of me
we look down on everyone
and we proclaim that we
don't know how long we'll be
as we kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
kiss the world goodbye
0and we'll be gone
into the sky and out of our minds
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time
wish us luck


i've taken time
to think about the words i've said and what they mean
and i've realized that having you is just like having everything

but when i see you dancing there
i get up and throw my hands in the air
when i've nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home

it's been so long
it seems the only things i know are far from home
where did i go
it seems sometimes i'm only good at being gone

but when i see you dancing there
i get up and throw my hands in the air
when i've nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home

but when i see you standing there
i get up and throw my hands in the air
when i've nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home

when i've nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home
home, home
when i've nowhere else to roam
i slowly start to think about coming home


every day, people sway
softly lulling me to sleep
i look the other way
but i still can't look too deep
i think i'll fall asleep
i think i'll fall asleep

so call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everything's gonna be fine

gently lulling me to sleep
what gives me the right
to waste away and weep
i think i'll turn away
there's nothing left to say

so call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everything's gonna be fine
so you wanna have everything your heart desires
there's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire
make your way on up to the front of the line

get out of my way
i'm here now to stay
get out of my way
i'm here now to stay

so call up and tell him that you will survive
good looking kid with the velvet eyes
you and me and everything's gonna be fine
so you wanna have everything your heart desires
there's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire
make your way on up to the front of the line


you have this way of dipping in and out of sight as things collide
and you have this way of falling in and out of time as it goes by
passing silently with no goodbye
and i've spoken with all the other angels
they don't know what to do
and i agree with them whole-heartedly, i do

telegram came today from a friend saying
where in the hell have you been?
where are you goin'?
i said i don't know, does the loneliness show,
and if so does it ever end?
and i've spoken with all the other angels
and they don't know what to do
and i agree with them whole-heartedly, i do

you have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me at the same time
returning my hellos with goodbyes
'cause i've spoken with all the other angels
they don't know what to do
and i agree with them whole-heartedly, i do

'cause i've spoken with all the other angels
they don't know what to do
and i agree with them whole-heartedly, i do

and i've spoken with all the other angels
they don't know what to do
and i agree with them whole-heartedly, i do


she sits all alone reading books and drinkin' wine
admires all the cracks by the doorway
she tries to look happy but she's slowly running out of smiles
gracefully wasting away

who is gonna make the birds sing?
who is gonna be her everything?
everyday goodbyes

she foolishly tries to convince herself that she'll be fine
she blows all her kisses to no one
as the phone rings again, she just closes her eyes
she covers her ears and screams "please not today!"

who is gonna make the birds sing?
who is gonna be her everything?
everyday goodbyes

she cries and then she sighs
and gets down on her knees yelling "i don't believe what has happened to me"
she cries and then she sighs
and gets down on her knees yelling "i don't believe what has happened to me"

who is gonna make the birds sing?
who is gonna be her everything?
everyday goodbyes


 alright...
 i read the news today, oh boy...
 about a lucky man who made the grade...
 i told you i was gonna run out of rhythm...
 i read the news today, oh boy...
 about a lucky man who made the grade...
 and though the news was rather sad...


how dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable?
so condescending, unnecessarily critical
i have the tendency of getting very physical
so watch your step, 'cause if i do you'll need a miracle

you drain me dry and make me wonder why i'm even here
this double vision i was seein' is finally clear
you want to stay, but you know very well i want you gone

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

is there anyone out there?
'cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there?
'cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe

what you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
you should know better, you never listened to a word i said
clutchin' your pillow and writhin' in a naked sweat
hoping somebody someday will do you like i did

and when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

say, is there anyone out there?
'cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there?
'cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe

does it kill? does it burn?
is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?
does it thrill? does it sting?
when you feel what i bring and you wish that you had me to hold

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

say, is there anyone out there?
'cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there?
'cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there?
'cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe


i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart

oh, this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breakin' in front of me
and i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore
whoa, whoa, whoa

i tried my best to feed her appetite
so hard to keep her satisfied
oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again

but uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breakin' in front of me
and i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore
whoa, whoa, whoa

i'll fix these broken things
repair your broken wings
my pressure on your hips
i'm sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you
'cause i know that's what you want me to do

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breakin' in front of me
and i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and my heart is breakin' in front of me
she said goodbye too many times before

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breakin' in front of me
but i have no choice, 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore...


you build me up, you knock me down
provoke a smile, then make me frown
you are the queen of runaround
you know it's true

you chew me up, you spit me out
enjoy the taste i leave in your mouth
you look at me, i look at you
neither of us know what to do

and there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess i'd better find a new way in
and i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you, but it's not the same
i won't be satisfied 'til i'm under your skin

immobilized by the thought of you
paralyzed by the sight of you
hypnotized by the words you say
not true, but i believe 'em anyway

so come to bed, it's getting late
there's no more time for us to waste
remember how my body tastes
you feel your heart begin to race

and there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess i'd better find a new way in
and i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you, but it's not the same
i won't be satisfied 'til i'm under your skin

feel your heart begin to race

there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess i'd better find a new way in
and i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you, but it's not the same
i won't be satisfied 'til i'm under your skin

there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess i'd better find a new way in
and i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you, but it's not the same
i won't be satisfied 'til i'm under your skin


beauty queen of only eighteen
she had some trouble with herself
he was always there to help her
she always belonged to someone else

i drove for miles and miles
and wound up at your door
i've had you so many times
but somehow, i want more

i don't mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile

and she will be loved
and she will be loved

tap on my window, knock on my door
i want to make you feel beautiful
i know i tend to get so insecure
it doesn't matter anymore

it's not always rainbows and butterflies
it's compromise that moves us along, yeah
my heart is full, and my door's always open
you come anytime you want, yeah

i don't mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile

and she will be loved
and she will be loved

know all of the things that make you who you are
i know that goodbye means nothing at all
comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

tap on my window, knock on my door
i want to make you feel beautiful

i don't mind spending every day
out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile

and she will be loved
and she will be loved
and she will be loved

please don't try so hard to say goodbye
please don't try so hard to say goodbye

i don't mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain

please don't try so hard to say goodbye


i'm full of regret
for all the things that i have done and said
and i don't know
if it'll ever be okay to show
my face around here
sometimes i wonder if i disappear

would you ever turn your head and look?
see if i'm gone
'cause i fear there is nothing left to say
to you, that you wanna hear
that you wanna know
i think i should go
the things i've done are way too shameful, oh

you're just an innocent
a helpless victim of a spider's web
and i'm an insect
going after anything that i can get

so you better turn your head and run
and don't look back
'cause i fear there is nothing left to say
to you, that you wanna hear
that you wanna know
i think i should go
the things i've done are way too shameful, oh

and i've done you so wrong
treated you bad, strung you along
oh, shame on myself
i don't know how i got so tangled up

mm, oh, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah...

you better turn your head and look
see if i'm gone
'cause i fear there is nothing left to say
to you, that you wanna hear
that you wanna know
i think i should go
the things i've done are way too shameful, oh

and i've done you so wrong
treated you bad, strung you along

i've done you so wrong
treated you bad, strung you along
oh, shame on myself
i don't know how i got so tangled up


after school, walkin' home
fresh dirt under my fingernails and
i can smell hot asphalt
cars screech to a halt to let me pass

and i cannot remember
what life was like through photographs
and trying to recreate images
life gives us from our past

and sometimes it's a sad song
but i

cannot forget, refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away, make everyday
worth all of the pain that i've gone through
and mama, i've been cryin'
'cause things ain't how they used to be
she said, the battle's almost won
and we're only several miles from the sun
woah, yeah

and i'm movin' on down my street
i see people i won't ever meet
i think of her, take a breath
feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

and sometimes it's a sad song
oh, but i

cannot forget, refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away, make everyday
worth all of the pain that i've gone through
and mama, i've been cryin'
'cause things ain't how they used to be
she said, the battle's almost won
and we're only several miles from the sun

the rhythm of the conversation
the perfection of her creation
the sex she slipped into my coffee
the way she felt when she first saw me
hate to love and love to hate her
like a broken record player
back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on

i cannot forget, refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away, make everyday
worth all of the pain that i've gone through
and mama, i've been cryin'
'cause things ain't how they used to be
she said, the battle's almost won
and we're only several miles
she said, the battle's almost won
and we're only several miles from the sun


i've been the needle and the thread
weaving figure eights and circles 'round your head
i try to laugh but cry instead
patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

fumbling through your dresser drawer
forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you cry

i'm lifting you up
i'm letting you down
i'm dancing till dawn
i'm fooling around
i'm not giving up
i'm making your love
this city's made us crazy and we must get out
oh yeah

this is not goodbye, she said
it is just time for me to rest my head
she does not walk, she runs instead
down these jagged streets and into my bed

when i was fumbling through your dresser drawer
forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you cry

i'm lifting you up
i'm letting you down
i'm dancing till dawn
i'm fooling around
i'm not giving up
i'm making your love
this city's made us crazy and we must get out

there's only so much i can do for you
after all of the things you put me through

oh, i'm lifting you up
i'm letting you down
i'm dancing till dawn
i'm fooling around
i'm not giving up
i'm making your love
this city's made us crazy and we must get out

i'm lifting you up
i'm letting you down
i'm dancing till dawn
i'm fooling around
i'm not giving up
i'm making your love
this city's made us crazy and we must get out

i'm fooling around
this city's made us crazy and we must get out


yeah...
sunday morning rain is falling
steal some covers, share some skin
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
you twist to fit the mold that i am in
but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
and i would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if i knew
that someday it would lead me back to you
that someday it would lead me back to you

that may be all i need
in darkness, she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave

fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
paint a picture with my hands
and back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
change the weather, still together when it ends

that may be all i need
in darkness, she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave
yeah!

oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
sunday morning rain is falling, and i'm calling out to you
singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
find a way to bring myself back home to you

you may not know
that may be all i need
in darkness, she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning, driving slow
oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah...
i'm a flower in your hair, i'm a flower in your hair
oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah...

get back here
get back here, yeah...


welcome to the land of fire
i hope you brought the right attire,
the crippled man is waiting at the door

he said "your eyes are much too bright"
the things you say are never right,
the sins of all the world lie on your head

so when you see me look the other way
cause -ohoh- lately all i do is play
all the glasses in the world say "come with me..."

i need a minute to get my head straight
just to hit it before it's too late
in a sin, considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
take a seat it's glittering, i shake you in, i shake my body

welcome to the land of fail
i hope you brought your soul for sale
the greeter's still at home i think he died

the land of smash and fairy tale
the truth of life is close to hell
the best you'll be is nearly dead or failed

so when you see me look the other way
cause lately all i do is say
these the plans i make believe all come with me

i need a minute to get my head straight
just to hit it before it's too late
in a sin, considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
take a seat it's glittering, i shake you in, i shake my body

oh, perhaps it's all a dream and make believe
oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me

i need a minute to get my head straight
just to hit it before it's too late
in a sin, considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
take a seat it's glittering, i shake you in, i shake my body


say goodbye to all your friends
they will miss you when this trends
i get so uptight, i get so uptight
i get so uptight, i get so uptight

why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, i've seen it
those things they believe in, they get hazy, i think i mean it

i get so uptight, i get so uptight
i get so uptight, i get so uptight

why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, i've seen it
those things they believe in, they get hazy, i think i mean it

why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, i've seen it
those things they believe in, they get hazy, i think i mean it


there's lights that line these halls
that beckon us to stay
a glimmer in the distance
that gathers all the stray
and when i need it most
it breaks into a song
that runs through all my veins
and helps me to hold on

we ran along into the spotlight
you sang a song that made the children cry
and all the people knew my name
it was a bright light
these lands combine into a great big mass
we sang along to the very last
oh, the jury stole my fame
and then we grabbed the sun
and it shined into these eyes
believe me

cover up, rain down
we wept on the edge of this town
i feel it
cover up, rain down
we wept on the edge of this town

oh, you look so alive
oh, did you think we'd cry?
oh, can you feel my heart?
i think i feel it, too
oh, did you think we'd die?

and then we grabbed the sun
and it shined into these eyes
believe me

cover up, rain down
we wept on the edge of this town
i feel it
cover up, rain down
we wept on the edge of this town

take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
flies it to the places where the silence screams
fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams

cover up, rain down
we wept on the edge of this town
i feel it
cover up, rain down
we wept on the edge of this town


she barely knew your name
he was just a city, she's just a dirt road
but that never meant a thing
running from the country, she needed out but, he held that diamond ring

'cause i can't sit oh i can't talk
i gotta leave this town and run to you
i gotta leave this town and come to you
ha ha ha
she barely knew your name

he was such a worry
no need to hurry
she would never listen
she left it all and headed towards the light
oh your eyes look tired
but love was all she knew
screaming out in agony she gave her life for you

'cause i can't sit oh i can't talk
i gotta leave this town and run to you
i gotta leave this town and come to you
ha ha ha
she barely knew your name

'cause i can't sit oh i can't talk
i gotta leave this town and run to you
i gotta leave this town and come to you
ha ha ha
she barely knew your name


i want my eyes to see these lights
hold hold hold on hold hold on
but when it comes it goes
i am on my knees, oh forgive me

hold hold hold on hold hold on
but when it comes it goes
i am on my knees

everything you say
is just a lie
and now i'm leaving
to the city where the people
are awake to chase a dream
that isn't real
and we 'posed to be somethin'
that we're not
just wanna change a lot
and sign our name after the dot

everything you see
is just a century of anarchy
all my corresponding colors
that symbolize the things
we can attest, arrange
we can assess, we can attain
we are the intrical entities
to entice and entertain

all eyes
they're on you
don't deny
you've got to
this is a call
that's all
you'll ever get from me
this is a call
that's all
you'll ever get from me

take my side
take my side
don't look back
i'm easy
and that's a fact
you're on my mind, oh

everything you say
is just a lie
and now i'm leaving
to the city where the people
are awake to chase a dream
that isn't real
and we 'posed to be somethin'
that we're not
just wanna change a lot
and sign our name after the dot

all eyes
they're on you
don't deny
you've got to
this is a call
that's all
you'll ever get from me

because your eyes they burn so bright
i'm all you've got
when you say
that you want
it all
you want it all

all eyes
they're on you
don't deny
you've got to
this is a call
that's all
you'll ever get from me
this is a call
that's all
you'll ever get from me

all eyes
they're on you
don't deny
you've got to
this is a call
that's all
you'll ever get from me

did your mother like your sunday dress
astrology irradicated
so what, so what?

it's all that we've got
it's all that we can give
believe it or not,
it's all that we can give, and i don't mind

i'm not out for us to fly or be set free
so what, so what?
i'd show you, you'd show me, so much, so much

it's all that we've got
it's all that we can give
believe it or not,
it's all that we can give, and i don't mind

your blood, it flows in from the western sea
your eyes, they shine in through this shaded tree
oh i believe in you
these places, they have changed
i don't know anything but you know me,
oh, you know me

it's all that we can give
believe it or not,

try...
try to hear my voice
you can leave, now it's your choice

maybe if i fall asleep, i won't breathe right

i said it before, i won't say it again
love is a game to you, let's not pretend
maybe if i fall asleep, i won't breathe right

can nobody hear me?
i've got a lot that's on my mind
i cannot breathe
can you hear it, too?

you kiss and you kiss
and you love and you love
you've got a history list and the rest is above
and if you won, you can't relate to me
from the floor to the floor
and the sky to the sky
you've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
and if you won, then you can't relate to me

i said it before, i won't say it again
love is a game to you, let's not pretend
maybe if i fall asleep, i won't breathe right, right, right

can nobody hear me?
i've got a lot that's on my mind
i cannot breathe
can you hear it, too?

leave your shoes at the door, baby
i am all you adore, lady
come with me and we will run away

can nobody hear me?
i've got a lot that's on my mind
i cannot breathe
can you hear it, too?
can nobody hear me?
i've got a lot that's on my mind
i cannot breathe
can you hear it, too?


to the top of all the world
to the tasteless underworld
to the center of your heart, oh cleopatra is the only one you loved
to the demonstrated smile
to the lonely love child
destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
just a picture on your wall
that's nice, what a metaphoric fall
typically, i was a validation on your sleeve
oh what an indication
to the center of the pain
through your tattered window pane
to the middle of your heart

resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
love is clueless and destiny is wishing
this is my heart, it's on the line, selene

this is not what i expect, this is not what i expect
i can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the caesar
typically, i was a validation on your sleeve
oh what an indication
to the center of the pain
through your tattered window pane
to the middle of your heart

resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
love is clueless and destiny is wishing
this is my heart, it's on the line, selene

resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
love is clueless and destiny is wishing
this is my heart, it's on the line, selene


emma stood in front of me
tellin' me what i'm supposed to be
jackie loves to run and hide
give her love, and she will die

calling me, oh my oh my

bourbon streets and bicycles
holding you in carnivals

baby is my love too old for you?
baby is my love too old for you?
'cause emma i'm for you
emma i'm for you

dinner bells and loaded gun
innocence is bound to run
enemies are playing from
but don't you touch that golden sun

innoncence and sentiment
is owned by hope its where you're at
baby is my love too old for you?
emma i'm for you
emma i'm for you

so this is what you meant?
when you said that you were spent?
and now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
right to the top
don't hold back
packing my bags and giving the academy a raincheck

i don't ever want to let you down
i don't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

so this is where you fell
and i am left to sell
the path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
right to the top
don't look back
turning to rags and giving the commodities a raincheck

i don't ever want to let you down
i don't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

this road never looked so lonely
this house doesn't burn down slowly
to ashes, to ashes

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am


i'm sorry, mother... i'm sorry, i let you down.

well, these days i'm fine - no these days i tend to lie.

i'll take the west train, just by the side of amsterdam,

just by my left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.

i'm sorry, brother... i'm sorry, i let you down.

well, these days you're fine - no these days you tend to lie.

you'll take the west train, just by the side of amsterdam,

just by your left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

but i keep coming up short.

i'm sorry lover, i'm sorry i bring you down.

well, these days i've tried and these days i tend to lie.

kinda thought i was a mystery and then i thought it wasn't meant to be,

you said yourself fantastically, "congratulations you were all alone".

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

but the rain won't fall for the both of us,

and sun won't shine on the both of us.

believe me when i say, that i wouldn't have it any other way.

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

but i won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.

oh i won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.

and i keep coming up shore...

but dismissed it from the interest
it was a risk just for a mistress who was a hostess on the west-coast
baby's got a lot of baggage

when the world has gone to sleep
you gotta get up
when doubts begin to rise
and the world is at your feet
you gotta get up

reach, it's not as bad as it seems
i cleanse in the river for somebody else,
for anyone but myself

i'm not a selfless man
i'm not a man of wealth
if i had all the world,
probably give it to myself
but the trees begin to walk
and the ground begins to talk
and myself

reach, it's not as bad as it seems
i cleanse in the river for somebody else,
for anyone but myself

hold my place
don't you give up on me
hold on... hold on

reach, it's not as bad as it seems
i cleanse in the river for somebody else,
for anyone but myself

i'll be around the boys
i've got nothing but time - on no... oh no
you've got me holding on to nothing
but nothing is all i've got

leave me, leave me, i'm shuttering all down
you've got a tendency to bring me down
i give up! i give up!
you've gotta get a gun to make a woman run

so this is what it feels like
i'll give you the last word
it's all right... it's all right... it's all right
and this is the town, this is the place
if you are the one to give disgrace a name
so be it

you've got me holding on to nothing
but nothing is all i've got

leave me, leave me, i'm shuttering all down
you've got a tendency to bring me down
i give up! i give up!
you've gotta get a gun to make a woman run

you've got me feeling like a pantomime
that's why i only love you part time
it's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you, don't you touch me no more"

you got me feeling like a paradigm
your friends all want me in the meantime
it's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you, don't you touch me no more"

hey, you got all the money, honey
your eyes are looking runny and red
hey, you think all your friends are funny
but all your friends are way overfed

you left me, baby, for another man
he's looking tall, he's got a deep tan
it's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you, don't you touch me no more"

he's got religious with the rhinestones
takes care of business on his cellphone
it's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you dare touch me no more"

hey, you got all the money, honey
your eyes are looking runny and red
hey, you think all your friends are funny
but all your friends are way overfed

if you've gotta go, i won't stop you
you'll hear me singing you
"glory! glory! hallelujah... you've made it easy for the both of us"

if he's got a chest and some arms
he'll hear me singing you
"glory! glory! hallelujah... you've made it easy for the both of us"

take me on a whim
it's not the sun that provides us
it's not the moon that divides us

i can barely swim
and the current's coming in
and the current's coming in again

stand up when you hear your name
'cause i think that we're the same
we've got the same old hands
we've made the same old plans

look how far we've come
some were never meant to come here
some were never meant to leave the ground

look how far we've come
some were never meant to come here
some were never meant to leave the ground

it's not the colour i came in
it's not the shirt that i stayin' in

hang me on a limb
and the current's coming in
and the current's coming in again

stand up when you hear your name
'cause i think that we're the same
we've got the same old hands
we've made the same old plans

i'm waking up to ash and dust
i wipe my brow and sweat my rust
i'm breathing in the chemicals

i'm breaking in and shaping up
then checking out on the prison bus
this is it, the apocalypse, whoa

i'm waking up, i feel it in my bones
enough to make my system blow
welcome to the new age, to the new age
welcome to the new age, to the new age

whoa oh... whoa... i'm radioactive, radioactive
whoa oh... whoa... i'm radioactive, radioactive

i raise my flag, dye my clothes
it's a revolution, i suppose
we're painted red to fit right in, whoa

i'm breaking in and shaping up
then checking out on the prison bus

when the days are cold and the cards all fold
and the saints we see are all made of gold
when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

i want to hide the truth, i want to shelter you
but with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
no matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

when you feel my heat, look into my eyes
it's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
don't get too close, it's dark inside
it's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

at the curtain's call, it's the last of all
when the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
so they dug your grave and the masquerade
will come calling out at the mess you've made

don't want to let you down but i am hellbound
though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
no matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

when you feel my heat, look into my eyes
it's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
don't get too close, it's dark inside
it's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

they say it's what you make, i say it's up to fate
it's woven in my soul, i need to let you go
your eyes, they shine so bright, i want to save that light
i can't escape this now unless you show me how

when you feel my heat, look into my eyes
it's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
don't get too close, it's dark inside
it's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide


if you love somebody
better tell them while they're here 'cause
they just may run away from you

you'll never know what went well
then again it just depends on
how long of time is left for you

i've had the highest mountains
i've had the deepest rivers
you can have it all but not keep moving

now take it in but don't look down

'cause i'm on top of the world, 'ay

take you with me if i can
been dreaming of this since a child
i'm on top of the world

i've tried to cut these corners
try to take the easy way out
i kept on falling short of something

i coulda gave up then but
then again i couldn't have 'cause
i've traveled all this way for something

i take it in but don't look down

'cause i'm on top of the world, 'ay
i'm on top of the world, 'ay

we are all living the same way
we are escaping the same way
circling
we are a part of the same play
we think we're making our own way
circling

you don't have to hold your head up high

round and round
i won't run away this time
till you show me what this life is for
round and round
i'm not gonna let you change my mind
till you show me what this life is for

we are afflicted by fiction
building a case for eviction
circling
guarding a tower of ancients
shooting down arrows of patience
and patiently circling

you don't have to hold your head up high

round and round
i won't run away this time
till you show me what this life is for
round and round
i'm not gonna let you change my mind
till you show me what this life is for

all the emptiness inside you
is hard enough to fill
without a sense of purpose
were setting up to fail
you don't have to make it right
just hold your head up high

round and round
i won't run away this time
till you show me what this life is for
round and round
i'm not gonna let you change my mind
till you show me what this life is for


so this is what you meant?
when you said that you were spent?
and now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
right to the top
don't hold back
packing my bags and giving the academy a raincheck

i don't ever want to let you down
i don't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

so this is where you fell
and i am left to sell
the path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
right to the top
don't look back
turning to rags and giving the commodities a raincheck

i don't ever want to let you down
i don't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

this road never looked so lonely
this house doesn't burn down slowly
to ashes, to ashes

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand
that i'm never changing who i am

it's time to begin, isn't it?
i get a little bit bigger, but then i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
now don't you understand

fog in the air
just to make my mind seem clear
where do i go from here?
i see my breath pushing steam through the air
shaking hands run through my hair
my fears, where do i go from here?

is it my fault, is it my fault?
we've been missing each other
we've been missing each other
my fault, is it my fault?
we've been missing each other
we've been missing each other

walking down to the water's edge
asking why i'm here instead of home
now i stand alone
i stop to stare at the ocean side
i'm breathing in just to feel it's side
with his
like you were here with me

is it my fault, is it my fault?
we've been missing each other
we've been missing each other
my fault, is it my fault?
we've been missing each other
we've been missing each other

it's in the brightest light
it's when the world is moving
oh, it's in the faintest cry
it's in the lover's eye
is when i need you most
and don't you know?

is it my fault, is it my fault?
we've been missing each other
we've been missing each other
my fault, is it my fault?
we've been missing each other
we've been missing each other

is it my fault, is it my fault?
we've been missing each other
we've been missing each other
my fault, is it my fault?

in the morning light let my roots take flight
watch me fall above like a vicious dove
they don't see me come, who can blame them?
they never seem to catch my eye but i never wondered why

i won't fall asleep
i won't fall asleep

hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
hey yeah, tiptoe higher
take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
hey yeah, tiptoe higher

from your slanted view see the morning dew
sink into the soil, watch the water boil
they won't see me run who can blame them?
they never look to see me fly, so i never had to lie

i won't fall asleep
i won't fall asleep

hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
hey yeah, tiptoe higher
take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low

i'm sorry, mother... i'm sorry, i let you down.

well, these days i'm fine - no these days i tend to lie.

i'll take the west train, just by the side of amsterdam,

just by my left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.

i'm sorry, brother... i'm sorry, i let you down.

well, these days you're fine - no these days you tend to lie.

you'll take the west train, just by the side of amsterdam,

just by your left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

but i keep coming up short.

i'm sorry lover, i'm sorry i bring you down.

well, these days i've tried and these days i tend to lie.

kinda thought i was a mystery and then i thought it wasn't meant to be,

you said yourself fantastically, "congratulations you were all alone".

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

but the rain won't fall for the both of us,

and sun won't shine on the both of us.

believe me when i say, that i wouldn't have it any other way.

your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,

it's hard, believe me... i've tried.

but i won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.

oh i won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.

and i keep coming up shore...

trying not to roam but you're so
far away, so far away

i'm conscious but i'm lonely, halfway dead
tired of the things you never...

you came and broke the perfect girl
our love was made to rule the world

our love was made to rule the world
you left me wanting what we were
our love was made to rule the world

forget forever
forget forever
forget you ever
knew my name, my name, my name, my name

that we were never lovers in the end
i try to tell myself this pain would...
go away... just go away!

our love was made to rule the world
you came and broke the perfect girl
our love was made to rule the world

our love was made to rule the world
you left me wanting what we were
our love was made to rule the world

forget forever
forget forever
forget you ever
knew my name, my name, my name, my name

forget forever
forget forever

in the dark we can see
feel your hand touching me
run away from the world outside we know
in your lips i confide
in our love we can hide
run away from our world outside we know

and when i waken next to you
i know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
i'm never giving up on this

and you can't stop my heart
you're taking on me like i'm taking on you
and it's my favorite part
and you can't stop my heart
the lover in me is the lover in you

'cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me
run away from the world outside we know

you got me sippin' on something
i can't compare to nothing
i've ever known, i'm hoping
that after this fever i'll survive
i know i'm acting a bit crazy
strung out, a little bit hazy
hand over heart, i'm praying
that i'm gonna make it out alive

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice 'cause i won't hear
you might be right but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

you got me scattered in pieces
shining like stars and screaming
lighting me up like venus
but then you disappear and make me wait
and every second's like torture
heroin drip, no more so
finding a way to let go
baby, baby no i can't escape

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice 'cause i won't hear
you might be right but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

this is a modern fairytale
no happy endings
no wind in our sails
but i can't imagine a life without
breathless moments
breaking me down, down, down, down

the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice 'cause i won't hear
you might be right but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants

the heart wants what it wants baby
it wants what it wants baby
it wants what it wants
it wants what it wants

the heart wants what it wants baby
it wants what it wants baby...

you were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
flashing those eyes like highway signs
light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
i just wanna feel your lips against my skin

you told me this is right where it begins
but your lips hang heavy underneath me
and i promised myself i wouldn't let you complete me

i'm trying not to let it show, that i don't want to let this go
is there somewhere you can meet me?
'cause i clutched your arms like stairway railings
and you clutched my brain and eased my ailing

you're writing lines about me; romantic poetry
your girl's got red in her cheeks, 'cause we're something she can't see
and i try to refrain but you're stuck in my brain
and all i do is cry and complain because second's not the same

could we pretend that we're in love?

could we pretend that we're in love?


i'm searching for something that i can't reach

i don't like them innocent
i don't want no face fresh
want them wearing leather
begging, let me be your taste test
i like the sad eyes, bad guys
mouth full of white lies
kiss me in the corridor
but quick to tell me goodbye

you say that you're no good for me
'cause i'm always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost, where'd you go?
i can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost, where'd you go?
what happened to the soul, that you used, to be?

you're a rolling stone boy
never sleep alone boy
got a million numbers
and they're filling up your phone, boy
i'm off the deep end, sleeping
saying that i love him but
i know i'm gonna leave him

you say that you're no good for me
'cause i'm always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost, where'd you go?
i can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost, where'd you go?
what happened to the soul, that you used, to be?

i'm searching for something that i can't reach

my ghost, where'd you go?
i can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost, where'd you go?
what happened to the soul, that you used, to be?


there's a place way down in bed stuy
where a boy lives behind bricks
he's got an eye for girls of eighteen
and he turns them out like tricks

i went down to a place in bed stuy
a little liquor on my lips
i let him climb inside my body
and held him captive in my kiss

and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting

i'm a wanderess
don't belong to no city
don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain
i'm a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
i'm a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
i'm a hurricane

i went down to a place in brooklyn
where you tripped on lsd
and i found myself reminded
to keep you far away from me

and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting

i'm a wanderess
don't belong to no city
don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain
i'm a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
i'm a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
i'm a hurricane

he says, "oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
well lately, i like 'em crazy
oh, maybe, you could devastate me
little lady, come and fade me."

i'm a wanderess
don't belong to no city
don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain

come and fade me
come and fade me
i'm a hurricane


i, i must confess
how hard i tried to breathe
through the trees of loneliness
and you, you must confess
how hard you need to see
through the heart beating out my chest

feel like we've been falling down
like these autumn leaves
but baby don't let winter come
don't let our hearts freeze

if the morning light don't steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold

smoke as black as charcoal
fills into our fragile lungs
'cause when our demons come
dancing in the shadows
to a game that can't be won

feel like we've been falling down
like these autumn leaves
but baby don't let winter come
don't let our hearts freeze

if the morning light don't steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold
if the morning light don't steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold

we're the underdogs in this world alone
i'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
we're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
they can break our hearts, they won't take our souls

we're the underdogs in this world alone
i'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
we're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
they can break our hearts, they won't take our souls

if the morning light don't steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold
if the morning light don't steal our soul
we will walk away from empty gold
we will walk away from empty gold


would you bleed for me?
lick it off my lips like you needed me?
would you sit me on a couch?
with your fingers in my mouth?
you look so cool when you're reading me

let's cause a little trouble
oh, you make me feel so weak
i bet you kiss your knuckles
right before they touch my cheek

but i've got my mind, made up this time
cause there's a menace in my bed
can you see his silhouette?
can you see his silhouette?
can you see his silhouette?

and i've got my mind, made up this time
go on and light a cigarette, set a fire in my head

would you lie for me?
cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
would you pin me to a wall?
would you beg or would you crawl?
stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?

let's cause a little trouble
oh, you make me feel so weak
i bet you kiss your knuckles
right before they touch my cheek

and i've got my mind, made up this time
go on and light a cigarette, set a fire in my head

don't forget me, don't forget me
i wouldn't leave you if you'd let me
hmm, when you met me when you met me
you told me you were gonna get me

don't forget me don't forget me
i wouldn't leave you if you'd...

and i've got my mind, made up this time
cause there's a menace in my bed
can you see his silhouette?
can you see his silhouette?
can you see his silhouette?

and i've got my mind, made up this time
go on and light a cigarette, set a fire in my head


sick of all these people talking
sick of all this noise
tired of all these cameras flashing
sick of being poised
and now my neck is open wide
begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride
so there's no use crying about it

i'm headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and there's an old man sitting on the throne
that's saying that i probably shouldn't be so mean
i'm headed straight for the castle
they've got this kingdom locked up
and there's an old man sitting on the throne
that's saying i should probably keep my pretty mouth shut

all of these people passing
saying that they're feeling abused
if you wanna break these walls down
you're gonna get bruised
and now my neck is open wide
begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride
so there's no use crying about it

i'm headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and there's an old man sitting on the throne
that's saying that i probably shouldn't be so mean
i'm headed straight for the castle

my demons are begging me to open up my mouth
i need them mechanically make the words come out
they fight me, vigorous and angry, watch them pounce
ignite me, licking up the flames they bring about

i sold my soul to a three-piece
and he told me i was holy
he's got me down on both knees
but it's the devil that's tryna

hold me down, hold me down
sneaking out the back door
make no sound
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

hold me down, hold me down
throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

selfish, taking what i want and call it mine
i'm helpless, clinging to a little bit of spine
they rush me, telling me i'm running out of time
they shush me, walking me across a fragile line

i sold my soul to a three-piece
and he told me i was holy
he's got me down on both knees
but it's the devil that's tryna

hold me down, hold me down
sneaking out the back door
make no sound
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

hold me down, hold me down
throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

hold me down now
hold me down now
hold me down

i sold my soul to a three-piece
and he told me i was holy
he's got me down on both knees
but it's the devil that's tryna

hold me down, hold me down
sneaking out the back door
make no sound
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

hold me down, hold me down
throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for

my hands wrapped around your stick shift
swerving on the 405, i can never keep my eyes off this
my neck, the feeling of your soft lips
illuminated in the light, bouncing off the exit signs i missed

all we do is drive
all we do is think about the feelings that we hide
all we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
sick and full of pride
all we do is drive

and california never felt like home to me
and california never felt like home
and california never felt like home to me
until i had you on the open road and now we're singing

your laugh, echoes down the hallway
carves into my hollow chest, spreads over the emptiness
it's bliss
it's so simple but we can't stay
over analyze again, would it really kill you if we kissed

all we do is drive
all we do is think about the feelings that we hide
all we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
sick and full of pride
all we do is drive

and california never felt like home to me
and california never felt like home
and california never felt like home to me
until i had you on the open road and i was singing


'cause i remember when my father put his fist through the wall that separated the dining room.
and i remember the fear in your eyes the very first time we snuck into the city pool
late december, with my heart in my chest, and the clouds of my breath,
didn't know where we were running to.
but don't look back...

we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind.
we'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
to the bottom of the line.
and we know that we're headstrong,
and our heart's gone,
and the timing's never right,
nut for now let's get away
on a roman holiday.

could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to queen's?
'cause i imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat.
and when it happens, i'll be miles away and a few months late,
didn't know where i was running to.
but i won't look back...

we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind.
we'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
to the bottom of the line.
and we know that we're headstrong,
and our heart's gone,
and the timing's never right,
nut for now let's get away
on a roman holiday.

feet first, don't fall
we'll be running again
keep close, stand tall

we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
till our wide eyes burn blind.
we'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
to the bottom of the line.
and we know that we're headstrong,
and our heart's gone,
and the timing's never right,
nut for now let's get away
on a roman holiday.


your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
you said your mother only smiled on her tv show
you're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
i hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

you're dripping like a saturated sunrise
you're spilling like an overflowing sink
you're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
and now i'm tearing through the pages and the ink

everything is blue
his pills, his hands, his jeans
and now i'm covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and it's blue
and it's blue

everything is grey
his hair, his smoke, his dreams
and now he's so devoid of color
he don't know what it means
and he's blue
and he's blue

you were a vision in the morning when the light came through
i know i've only felt religion when i'm lying with you
you said you'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too
and i'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

you're dripping like a saturated sunrise
you're spilling like an overflowing sink
you're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
and i'm tearing through the pages and the ink

everything is blue
his pills, his hands, his jeans
and now i'm covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and it's blue
and it's blue

everything is grey
his hair, his smoke, his dreams
and now he's so devoid of color
he don't know what it means
and he's blue
and he's blue

everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue

you were red and you liked me 'cause i was blue
you touched me and suddenly i was a lilac sky
and you decided purple just wasn't for you

everything is blue
his pills, his hands, his jeans
and now i'm covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and it's blue
and it's blue

everything is grey
his hair, his smoke, his dreams
and now he's so devoid of color
he don't know what it means
and he's blue
and he's blue

everything is blue
everything is blue

i found god
i found him in a lover
when his hair falls in his face
and his hands so cold they shake

i found the devil
i found him in a lover
and his lips like tangerine
in his color coded speak

now we're lost somewhere in outer space
in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet
we roll around beneath these sheets

i've got a lover
a love like religion
i'm such a fool for sacrifice
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
and i'm unforgiving
i'm such a fool to pay this price
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i found a martyr
he told me that he'd never
with his educated eyes
and his head between my thighs

i found a savior
i don't think he remembers
'cause he's off to pay his crimes
and he's got no time for mine

now we're lost somewhere in outer space
in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet
we roll around beneath these sheets

i've got a lover
a love like religion
i'm such a fool for sacrifice
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
and i'm unforgiving
i'm such a fool to pay this price
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

every single time make a compromise

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
a love like religion
i'm such a fool for sacrifice
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
and i'm unforgiving
i'm such a fool to pay this price
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

every single time make a compromise

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down


i was as pure as a river
but now i think i'm possessed
you put a fever inside me
and i've been cold since you left
i've got a boyfriend now and he's made of gold
and you've got your own mistakes in a bed at home
i'm hoping you could save me now but you break and fold
you've got a fire inside but your heart's so cold

'cause i've done some things that i can't speak
and i've tried to wash away but you just won't leave
so won't you take a breath and dive in deep
'cause i came here so you'd come for me

i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me
i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me

we walk as tall as the skyline
and we have roots like the trees
but then your eyes start to wander
'cause they weren't looking at me
you weren't looking for me

'cause i've done some things that i can't speak
and i've tried to wash away but you just won't leave
so won't you take a breath and dive in deep
'cause i came here so you'd come for me

i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me
i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me


they send me away to find them a fortune
a chest filled with diamonds and gold
the house was awake
the shadows and monsters
the hallways they echoed and groaned

and i sat alone, in bed till the morning
and crying, "they're coming for me"
and i tried to hold these secrets inside me
my mind's like a deadly disease

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

i paced around for hours, i'm empty
i jumped at the slightest of sounds
and i couldn't stand the person inside me
i turned all the mirrors around

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

i'm well acquainted
with villains that live in my head
they beg me to write them
so they'll never die when i'm dead

and i've grown familiar
with villains that live in my head
they beg me to write them
so i'll never die when i'm dead

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me

he says, "oh, baby girl, you know we're gonna be legends
i'm the king and you're the queen and we will stumble through heaven
if there's a light at the end, it's just the sun in your eyes

and i've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
for a while now, drowning my thoughts out, the sounds

but do you feel like a young god?
you know the two of us are just young gods
and we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and they're running, running, running
but do you feel like a young god?
you know the two of us are just young gods
and we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and they're running, running, running again


he says "oh, baby girl, don't get caught on my edges
i'm the king of everything you know my tongue is a weapon
there's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs

and i've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
for a while now, drowning my thoughts out, the sounds

but do you feel like a young god?
you know the two of us are just young gods
and we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and they're running, running, running
but do you feel like a young god?
you know the two of us are just young gods
and we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and they're running, running, running again



i'm searching for something that i can't reach

i don't like them innocent
i don't want no face fresh
want them wearing leather
begging, let me be your taste test
i like the sad eyes, bad guys
mouth full of white lies
kiss me in the corridor
but quick to tell me goodbye

you say that you're no good for me
'cause i'm always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave
but i like it anyway

my ghost, where'd you go?
i can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
my ghost, where'd you go?
what happened to the soul, that you used, to be?

you're a rolling stone boy
never sleep alone boy
got a million numbers
and they're filling up your phone, boy
i'm off the deep end, sleeping
saying that i love him but
i know i'm gonna leave him

you say that you're no good for me
'cause i'm always tugging at your sleeve
and i swear i hate you when you leave

there's a place way down in bed stuy
where a boy lives behind bricks
he's got an eye for girls of eighteen
and he turns them out like tricks

i went down to a place in bed stuy
a little liquor on my lips
i let him climb inside my body
and held him captive in my kiss

and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting

i'm a wanderess
don't belong to no city
don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain
i'm a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
i'm a hurricane
ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
i'm a hurricane

i went down to a place in brooklyn
where you tripped on lsd
and i found myself reminded
to keep you far away from me

and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting now
and there's a storm you're starting

i'm a wanderess

he says, "oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
well lately, i like 'em crazy
oh, maybe, you could devastate me
little lady, come and fade me."

i'm a wanderess
don't belong to no city
don't belong to no man
i'm the violence in the pouring rain

everybody wants to know
how your hands felt in my hair
if we were high on amphetamines

and everybody wants to hear
how we chainsmoked until three
and how you laughed when you said my name
and how you gripped my hips so mean

but the ending is the same every damn time, no, no, no
but the ending is the same every damn time

they think i'm insane, they think my lover is strange
and i'm gonna write it all down, and i'm gonna sing it on stage

that's the beauty of a secret
you know you're supposed to keep it
that's the beauty of a secret
that's the beauty of a secret
you know you're supposed to keep it

everybody's waiting up to hear if i dare speak your name
put it deep beneath the track, like the hole you left in me
and everybody wants to know 'bout how it felt to hear you scream
they know you walk like you're a god, they can't believe i made you weak

but the ending is the same every damn time, no, no, no
but the ending is the same every damn time

they think i'm insane, they think my lover is strange

you know you're supposed to keep it
that's the beauty of a secret
that's the beauty of a secret
you know you're supposed to keep it

these days i can't seem to get along with anyone
get by with anyone
these days i can't seem to make this right
well, is this fine? will it be alright?

they think i'm insane, they think my lover is strange
and i'm gonna write it all down, and i'm gonna sing it on stage

that's the beauty of a secret
you know you're supposed to keep it
that's the beauty of a secret
that's the beauty of a secret
you know you're supposed to keep it


i found god
i found him in a lover
when his hair falls in his face
and his hands so cold they shake

i found the devil
i found him in a lover
and his lips like tangerine
in his color coded speak

now we're lost somewhere in outer space
in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet
we roll around beneath these sheets

i've got a lover
a love like religion
i'm such a fool for sacrifice
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
and i'm unforgiving
i'm such a fool to pay this price
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i found a martyr
he told me that he'd never
with his educated eyes
and his head between my thighs

i found a savior
i don't think he remembers
'cause he's off to pay his crimes
and he's got no time for mine

now we're lost somewhere in outer space
in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet
we roll around beneath these sheets

i've got a lover
a love like religion
i'm such a fool for sacrifice
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
and i'm unforgiving
i'm such a fool to pay this price
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

every single time make a compromise

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
a love like religion
i'm such a fool for sacrifice
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

i've got a lover
and i'm unforgiving
i'm such a fool to pay this price
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

every single time make a compromise

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down

it's coming down, down, i'm coming down
it's coming down, down, i'm coming down


i was as pure as a river
but now i think i'm possessed
you put a fever inside me
and i've been cold since you left
i've got a boyfriend now and he's made of gold
and you've got your own mistakes in a bed at home
i'm hoping you could save me now but you break and fold
you've got a fire inside but your heart's so cold

'cause i've done some things that i can't speak
and i've tried to wash away but you just won't leave
so won't you take a breath and dive in deep
'cause i came here so you'd come for me

i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me
i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me

we walk as tall as the skyline
and we have roots like the trees
but then your eyes start to wander
'cause they weren't looking at me
you weren't looking for me

'cause i've done some things that i can't speak
and i've tried to wash away but you just won't leave
so won't you take a breath and dive in deep
'cause i came here so you'd come for me

i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me
i'm begging you to keep on haunting
i'm begging you to keep on haunting me


are you insane like me? been in pain like me?
bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?

are you high enough without the mary jane like me?
do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?

and all the people say
"you can't wake up, this is not a dream
you're part of a machine, you are not a human being
with your face all made up, living on a screen
low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"

i think there's a fault in my code
these voices won't leave me alone
well my heart is gold and my hands are cold

are you deranged like me? are you strange like me?
lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
pointing fingers 'cause you'll never take the blame like me?

and all the people say
"you can't wake up, this is not a dream
you're part of a machine, you are not a human being
with your face all made up, living on a screen
low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"

i think there's a fault in my code
these voices won't leave me alone
well my heart is gold and my hands are cold


they send me away to find them a fortune
a chest filled with diamonds and gold
the house was awake
the shadows and monsters
the hallways they echoed and groaned

and i sat alone, in bed till the morning
and crying, "they're coming for me"
and i tried to hold these secrets inside me
my mind's like a deadly disease

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

i paced around for hours, i'm empty
i jumped at the slightest of sounds
and i couldn't stand the person inside me
i turned all the mirrors around

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

i'm well acquainted
with villains that live in my head
they beg me to write them
so they'll never die when i'm dead

and i've grown familiar
with villains that live in my head
they beg me to write them
so i'll never die when i'm dead

i'm bigger than my body
i'm colder than this home
i'm meaner than my demons
i'm bigger than these bones

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

and all the kids cried out
"please stop, you're scaring me"
i can't help this awful energy
goddamn right, you should be scared of me
who is in control?

he says, "oh, baby girl, you know we're gonna be legends
i'm the king and you're the queen and we will stumble through heaven
if there's a light at the end, it's just the sun in your eyes

and i've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
for a while now, drowning my thoughts out, the sounds

but do you feel like a young god?
you know the two of us are just young gods
and we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and they're running, running, running
but do you feel like a young god?
you know the two of us are just young gods
and we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and they're running, running, running again


he says "oh, baby girl, don't get caught on my edges
i'm the king of everything you know my tongue is a weapon
there's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs

and i've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
for a while now, drowning my thoughts out, the sounds

but do you feel like a young god?
you know the two of us are just young gods

i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep my eyes wide open all the time
i keep the ends out for the tie that binds
because you're mine, i walk the line

i find it very, very easy to be true
i find myself alone when each day is through
yes, i'll admit that i'm a fool for you
because you're mine, i walk the line
because you're mine, i walk the line

you've got a way to keep me on your side
you give me cause for love that i can't hide
for you i know i'd even try to turn the tide
because you're mine, i walk the line
because you're mine, i walk the line
because you're mine, i walk the line

because you're mine, i walk the line
because you're mine, i walk the line


two households, both alike in dignity
in fair verona, where we lay our scene
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny
where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
whose misadventured piteous overthrows
do with their death bury their parents' strife
the fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
and the continuance of their parents' rage
which, but their children's end, nought could remove
is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
the which if you with patient ears attend
what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend

i am a child of a
money hungry, prideful country
grass is green and it's always sunny
hands so bloody, tastes like honey
i'm finding it hard to leave

i am a child of a money hungry, prideful country

how can midas put his hands on me again?
he said "one day i'd realize why i don't have any friends"
unless i'm havin' sex
but he can make me golden if i just showed some respect

but i don't let him touch me anymore
i said "i'm not something to butter up
and taste when you get bored
to find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

he said "please don't go away"
he said "please don't go away"
i said "it's too late"
i said "it's too late"
he said "please don't go away"
he said "please don't go away"
i said "it's too late"
i said "it's too late"

and now i can't stop thinking that i can't stop thinking
that i almost gave you everything
and now the whole thing's finished and i can't stop wishing
that i never gave you anything

you wrote 100 letters just for me
and i find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans
now i'm constantly reminded of the time i was 19
every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine

but i don't let him touch me anymore
i said "i'm not something to butter up
and taste when you get bored
to find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

he said "please don't go away"
he said "please don't go away"
i said "it's too late"

that i almost gave you everything
and now the whole thing's finished and i can't stop wishing
that i never gave you anything
and then i can't stop thinking that i can't stop thinking
and now the whole thing's finished and i can't stop wishing
that i never gave you anything

and got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat
i'm tryna' stay under intoxication
'cause i lost my father, and got a daughter, plus i'm on probation
i'm drinkin' liquor like it's water, gettin' pissy drunk
and stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin' to give me some
i keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline
duckin the law, 'cause i ain't tryna' do no fed time
sometimes i just wish i could be away
but i gotta take care of everything and keep macita straight
so i just maintain the struggle and i keep tryin'
but how can i when my closest people keep dyin'
i ain't lyin' that the law tryna' bust my clique

i lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
and i'm still doin' for my mother and i'm payin' bills

the feds said they heard that i know where them birds at
and my old lady say she saw me with anotha brizzah
and some a the boys shot up my block so now i gotta kill 'em
and teachers keep tellin' my momma that i'm gettin' worse
and now she trippin' talkin' 'bout i need to be in church
and my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
tryna' put me, a child, on child support
and my own family deny me of what i do 'cause i'm a 'thug and stuff'
man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
we keep fightin but they so strong
i know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust

i lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
and i'm still doin' for my mother and i'm payin' bills

i mean the world just ain't gon' never change
so i just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang

like everybody against me 'cause i'm a young thug
dear rabbit, why they have to kill rabbit?
i only can depend on macita and c-m-r
but i'm upset so i'm steady wipin' tears away
and police got me under surveilance when and wherever
wreckin they brains, tryna' figure where i'm gettin' that cheddar
i tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
i can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
but i try to forget about it and just stand strong
but if everythang was cool i wouldn't write this damn song

i lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
and i'm still doin' for my mother and i'm payin' bills

sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin

baby and slim keep tellin' me, "juvenile, stay off them streets."
i'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
my life is four hundred degrees, so i bust 'em up
still stickin' to the g-code, ree's, and b's
quit drinkin', but i will smoke some weed indeed
all they understand is my project english
and if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

i'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
i'll even go k for k with ya - now make your choice
and empty a hundred out that k
where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me

young mobster, wild and obnoxious
pop some in your dreadlocks - what? me not no rookie, boy
glock cookin', boy
spark or lace somethin'
park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
and in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
if i live to be old, it's a miracle
that's why i keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
don't blame me, society changed me
cut off lights, we masked riders
the hood trash got us in a position we can't shake

we don't barrow nothin', don't fear nothin'
b.geezy, lil wheezy, juvy, two tymer

and i follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely

i swear to you man, at some times i really wish i was with you
'cause i get fed up with this life and i miss you
somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
i promise i won't ever put nothin' above you dog
so i live my life in dedication of you dog
i know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
but i know they got a reason why i'm here
and i know they got a reason why you gone
and therefore, i'm succeedin on my own
i can't forget you kept it real from the start

i slip a clip in every whip, cas hatas likely to trip
but i light me a spliff drink henney without ice when i'm pissed
but i'm a man so i'm here to handle my situtions correctly
but in the mean time i'm fightin gun charges in court
and in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
it's like i'm never happy now
except for the fact my daughter sayin' i love you daddy now
and that kinda juice me up and i smoke about 3 blunts
and puff a kool it boost me up
and say a prayer for everyday
just so i get through the stuff but i be like

ah man, it's complicated doin' everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody in ya home man
and when you feel like everythang is goin' wrong man
i'm gone stand 'cause i am a grown man

i try to keep my head up, but i die to keep my bread up
and usually i'm fed up thinkin' everythang's a set up
and i get hit up with all kinda stress
and put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough
but i mantain to climb through it all
and i still manage to be lil wayne therefore i shine and i ball
and dawg i live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow
and i borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
and i'm walkin' on the edge stuck without a solution
and someway i still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
and i don't need nobody else so keep yo advice and jus doubt me
cas y'all cats don't really no me y'all jus no 'bout me
so if my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
and plus i know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest
and i ain't neva said they don't appreciate what i do
but jus know if i wasn't a man i wouldn't make it through

who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic
but i chose my own life so i gradually accept it
i'm influenced and effected by the way it became
and i don't play with them at all so i don't say it's a game
and even though i grew up hard and i have gracefully change
i'm always street so i'll forever be facin a change
and i'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
and i demand respect from all if not then i'm waisten a man
and if i want it then i get and if i need it i have it
take care of them family first 'cause the liquir and weed is a habit
and i'm so often i'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
but when they turn they back i just have jesus leadin my path
and i didn't ask for you to like me i don't care if you hate me
but don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
and i'm faithfully inspired by the hood tell i'm gone
and dawg i do believe i'm grown

i apologize for waiting to tell you for so long
i am not human
i am made of bacon, fairy tales, pixie dust, i don't feel
i hung myself and didn't die
i'm omnipotent, i'm alive
not real, i'm alive

you leave me careless, i like it
i like it

caught up in the blast
caught up in the action
caught up in the bursting flame
there's comfort in dying
there's comfort in burning i burn

maybe we should burn
maybe we should burn, burn

doubt i'll ever be anyone's baby
living as a unicorn gets so lonely
i have no answers
i have no questions
stuck in your tandem
heat that's worth standing
i like it

i can feel the accidents happening slowly
falling for the rapture ever so boldly
i will go willingly
you don't have to kidnap
i'd like to be kidnapped
you leave me careless, i like it
i like it

maybe we should burn
maybe we should burn
maybe we should burn
maybe we should burn, burn

doubt i'll ever be anyone's baby


can anyone live with eartha kitt?

that's not for me to decide. that's for someone who decides to live with me to decide. not for me

but are you willing to compromise within a relationship?

to compromise? what is compromising? compromising for what? compromising for what reason? to compromise? for what? to compromise. what is compromise?

if a man came into your life, wouldn't you want to compromise?

stupid. a man comes into my life and i have to compromise? you must think about that one again.
a man comes into my life and you have to compromise? for what? for what? for what? a relationship is a relationship that has to be earned! not to compromise for! and i love relationships. i think they're fantastic. but one thing i think that's great i think is, nothing in the world more beautiful than falling in love. but falling in love for the right reasons. falling in love for the right purpose. falling in love. falling in love. when you fall in love, what is there to compromise about?

ise' got to make this quick
i don't want to waste time
make it faster, stronger, deeper
pulled out with the passion rolled out
roll out on the red carpet
roll out the chariot
friar, dancing
by the fire
singing
yeah
haven't we been here before
haven't you heard the end of the story?
it isn't over yet
keep patience on the left side of your brain
virtues are relative
no pain


pray for yourself one time
one time, time

young medusa
never sure, i just do
i jumped off the bridge
you say i fell
i say i flew
missing parachute
feeling like topanga
patty mayonnaise
kind of average
with queen qualities
got molecules, i possess
ever more nothing less

i think i'm starting to feel something
here in the dark
i think i'm starting to feel something

keep burning up
pray for yourself one time
one time, time

broken glass unswept in my mind
brooms to heavy to bare
struggles that i find
confusion
gravity is relative
sand castles are still real life
they hold dreams
like the real ones do
i take care building castles too


summertime sadness

goddess of forbidden love

i think i wanna go go there
show me the way to your hiding place
i think i wanna go go go go there
go to church if you scared

i lay formless
hands tied in my sheets
star signs say i'm rare
chosen
by who
i-i-i-i-i
i wonder who's watchin'
whose wing i'm under
sweep me up and i'll go
no questions take me
i'll go!

show me the way
yea yea yea
yea yea yea
yea yea yea

wouldn't you like to believe
i'm on the edge
i feel your power on my back
you're murderous, you're murderous
swept and i fall, euphoria
breeze in my eyes
wake me when it's over
wake me when it's over

so painless, i feel the fall
power trip, i need it all
i need it all

when you're around, i feel it
when i'm alone, i feel the waves
crashing, down down
here in your arms, surround me
i feel your wings


keep your intentions pure don't be scared don't mince words
i don't mince words
my narcissism keeps me level
keeps me straight no curve balls
got no curve balls stay straight here
you wish that i was less than i am
less than i will be but i won't
no i won't
kismet, serendipity
reflections
i am him and he is me
kismet... serendipity


clarity is a state of mind
freedom ain't real, who's sold you that lie?
i ain't buying it
so give it up give it up mama
undo your pants and your bra
i see you liking that, you must need a slice...
type a personality
extrovert, introvert, commonalities
a type a personality
just dumb enough to lie to me


superficial, superwoman
ain't you tired of that wind in your face?
your skin taste likes brussell sprouts i swear
can't seem to remember your face
so give it up give it up papa
make it make sense to me
i can not go any further then 2 steps in-front of me
i'm lost in...


ripping the heads off all my barbie dolls
toss them to the side, give them convertibles
click vroom, i like the way it rides up
ken had it all, skipper wanted more than
watching from the sidelines, wish that she had it
she wish that she had it
here in your backyard, building a fantasy
do you want to know me?
stuck in nintendo, you're the controller
street fighter sin search
i yelled finish him
i yelled, finish him
i'm desdemona
othello in tragedies
shakespeare in sorrows
where do i begin?
where do we begin?

i got l's on my record
weed on the vinyl
keys open doors when them keys is albino
now knock on my door when my stars is a lionel
i've been fishing for a minute for a minnow
only i know that a pawn is a trade
and a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
playing hooky for a tassel, spend a minute on the minor
winds on my window
ash on my skin, when the record low temps for the wind blow
only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
y'ar see
i crowd surf in a cypher
scuba in my shower, take an uber to my neighbors
used to pay the piper, till peter picked it better
now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
but memories keep coming back
wanna know how i used to was, how i used to was

just wondering how we used to was, how we used to was


here soon, here soon

but pray for a raincoat
go up to where they're blind to
mistakes
i know you worry a lot
i'll be here for you
do i care enough?
do i feel for you?
i can guarantee

come on, this one

i didn't know you tried
cause you wanted more
and didn't know you cried
cause you wanted more
things don't happen the way you hoped to
i'm just keeping a little hope, baby
i didn't know you tried
cause you wanted more

how could you forget that
i'm the one who
forgot all your mistakes
and dirty drawers
you know i care for you
when hell over earth came
i stood for you
will you stand for me?

funny how life is turning out
i don't have much to talk about
don't have much to write about
funny the words i do kick
it's funny what sticks
mama said i'm sensitive
i gotta work on that
not really
tired of using adjectives, i gotta build on that
you feel me?
not really

young man, tryna find the world in a broken hand


hey, hey glory child, hey

hey glory child, don't you worry
stuttering, shaken off your fear
beauty's never given in a hurry
so condescending, leave your questions here
hey glory child, don't you worry
i can see your skeleton so clear
doubting's only made your visions blurry
you're better off just looking in the mirror

show me a better way, i wish you could
show me a better way, i wish you would
come home today, you could
come home today

i am shooting stars you will never see me
watching over your every mistake
digging out of graves is never easy
handing you my shovel, here to take
always playing catch me if you can
gingerbread you heard i'm sweet to taste
close your eyes let go and count to ten
i'll keep track of every moment wasted

dear god make me a bird
so i can fly far, far far away

i recall your soul and it taste like
gardens, flowers, warm winds

quit clipping on your feet
quit clipping on your wings
sometimes we hate to leave somebody
what's happening to we?
warm winds on a space ride
i recall your soul and it taste like...
gardens, flowers, warm winds

quit clipping on your feet
quit clipping on your wings
sometimes we hate to leave somebody
what's happening to we?
warm winds on a space ride

sometimes, i call your name out loud
just to make sure it's you
sometimes, i crack my veins so bad
just to see if it's blue
you clean me up

sometimes i bite my lips and close my eyes
just to pretend it's you
that's when i think of you
we were all thirteen once
long live tramp stamps and pepper ann
you will never judge me for that
you will always love me for that

warm winds on a space ride
i recall your soul and it taste like...
gardens, flowers, warm winds


go forth, spread the news
i'm a little late
go on, cut the rope
i know you hate it
two knives, no fork
wonder who'd make it?
i lose for you, i choose for you

gun fighting
fatality, boy
hell fire, boy
i stay for eternity

for you, for you
for, for you i stay
for you, for you
for, for you i

sometimes i keep you in my mind
sometimes i let you go up high
i'm using everything i find
do anything to keep you tied up
tied up

stationary, birds await
small canary, princess
young savage girl, lost among the lily pads
one road no choice, i've given you this
move moons for you, i choose to do it


shotgun to the back of my heart
i don't turn around to see who let one ring out
said you'll never do me wrong?
guess we see how that plays out
is it true? is it true?

heading to the massacre
bodies arriving every day
look at those shells you heard
picking the bones up along the way
let it ring out

sharpshooter in my backyard
killed a small boy once, never told no one
if it wasn't for my shotgun, he'd be alive
and i'd be halfway, to heaven
instead of sitting in the dark, going through hell
you should've been here
wish you had been here

shotgun to the back of my heart
i don't turn around to see who let one ring out

lately i've been questioning
am i all that i pretend to be?
i doubt it, i doubt it
lately i've been questioning
am i all that i pretend to be?
i doubt it, i doubt it


crucify, cru-crucify me
crucify, cru-cru

i can't recall the last time i took, advice from anyone
shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
and i can't recall the last time i took advice from anyone
i'm sure i'll be the death of me
and i can't recall the last time i took love from anyone
i called daddy, who's got one anyway?
not me

are you hating yourself?
do you really hate me?
are you hating yourself?

was it worth it?
would you do it again?
aren't you tired?, of always making amends? oh

6am on a friday morning, my darkest hours
them heartless hours
my apartment is lost in a coffin
i'm dead to the world like i popped me a couple downers
down &amp; out on my luck
salt water all on my tux and i call, she don't pick up
then i fall when summer is ending
i mean there's no pretending i'm stuck in my ways and you're offended
that's life, that's you, this me, that vice
you're wrong, i'm right, that's right
i belong somewhere on ice
i'm cold, i'm a new blood type, even colder
cold shoulder, born sinner, you know? cole showed us!
i have nothing to lose, my dark side been well in-tuned
a gemini go show them faces
and this here just one of my moods, babylon

was it worth it?
would you do it again?
aren't you tired?, of always making amends? oh
crucify me

crucify, cru-crucify me
crucify, cru-cru

crucify, cru-crucify me
crucify, cru-cru

i'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears

who's god anyway?
you're mine any day

i wanna feel
your power
this final hour
tell me

are you losing yourself?
will you lose it for me?
are you losing yourself?

aren't you tired?, of always making amends? oh
crucify me

crucify, cru-crucify me
crucify, cru-cru

crucify, cru-crucify me

it took all of me not to answer
daddy warned me the perils of play
hard to deal god it's his standard
flying high and fearless baby
i've kissed death a thousand times before

remember me for who i was not who i am
i'll pray you never understand this
sweet, sweet, sweet sweet november

remember where that landed you last time
blind eye and the feel is dark and
heaven help if he leave you girl
i bet you bought two new thongs this time


it's up for discussion, up for reprise
slowly re-thinking if current disguise deceives me
the shattered ring
i can see it in your eyes

ready or not, loaded heart with a dagger
aim for your sweet spot
i know you'd rather be scared of
i know you'd rather just disappear
now that i'm here
i know you'd rather

giddy up goldilocks, you took too long to save me
bumping that jadakiss is dangerous for sanity
open my candy box, for you sir, sugar daddy


let the church say amen
release all my sins at the pulpit
it's the beginning of my sermon
you hold my hand as an infant
palms to the sky, adonai, ya allah
till they all come down
till we all fall down
down...

lines drawn in the sun
keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
just ride

when you don't know yourself
if it hurts you to explain
you're god in my eyes
just ride

up here, the air is so thin
mountains on my fingertips
i stand at the tippy, screaming at the top of my lungs
tears in my eyes
adonai, ya allah, answer my calls if you hear me?
adonai, ya allah, answer my calls if you're near me?

lines drawn in the sun
keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
just ride

when you don't know yourself
if it hurts you to explain
you're god in my eyes
just ride

lines drawn in the sun
keep the sun at your back
keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
just ride

it's the beginning


that is my greatest fear
that if, if i lost control
or did not have control, things would just, you know
i would be... fatal

i'm writing this letter to let you know
i'm really leaving

i ain't into s&amp;m, but my whip's off the chain
a little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
so wipe the smile on your grill off, i swear to god i'll piss a happy meal off
get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
i ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
life's hard, i swear to god, life is a dumb blonde white broad
with fake tits and a bad dye job
so finally i broke down and bought her an ipod
and caught her stealin' my music, so i tied her arms and legs to the bed
set up the camera and pissed twice on her
look, two pees and a tripod!
the moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?

i wanna get to know you
one dose of my lovin'
i'm simply going to drive you crazy

i wanna be your lover
i wanna get to know you, baby
one dose of my lovin'
i'm really gonna drive you crazy

i'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
swingin' them hips when you pass
i'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
jump on this harley
lets go smoke some of that bob marley
sip some bacardi
then go pull up at the afterparty
i think we make a perfect couple
but you think i'm trouble
maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
she got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
think i'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
your toes painted hair fixed all the time
and your gucci boots the same color as mine
if you read between the lines you can see that i want you
i betcha i have you doin' what you said that you won't do
making decisions shorty good things don't last long
your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
before i head home
i'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn

wonder why i don't call her
maybe because i'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
it gets annoying from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
she loves it when i'm in town
hate it when i'm not around
i get her and wear down
next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hittin' the ground
just enough to hold us down
i'm stickin' 'n' moving cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady

i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call me by my government name
her panties wet over fame
fall in love with my chain
i wonder if i wasn't an entertainer would she remain
surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
i'm not your boyfriend i'm your homie.

watching her lick her lips
i sweet talking her if she like
look i'm legit now used to break laws
now you can reap the benefit of world tours
big house big benz girl it yours
mink coats italian shoes stones with no flaws
you ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
all you gotta do is love me and be loyal
cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
come here let my touch on you i let you touch on me
put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
let me ride on you and you can ride on

i wanna get to know you
i wanna get to know you, baby
one dose of my lovin'
i'm simply gonna drive you, crazy

i wanna be your lover
i wanna get to know you, lady
one dose of my lovin'
i'm really gonna drive you, crazy

i wanna be your lover
i really understand you, baby
i want to be your lover
i really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.


you got spark, you, you got spunk;
you, you got something all the girls want...
you're like a candy store, and i'm a toddler;
you got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
your love, your love... your love, your love...
your love, your love... your love, your love...

uh... uh, yo...
he the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
might breeze through the ave, might stop at the gym,
and he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

anyway, i think i met him sometime before,
in a different life, or where i record...
i mean... he was adam, i think i was eve,
but my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

s-s-s on my chest, 'cause i'm ready to save him,
ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
and i think i love him, i love him just like i raised him;
when he call me "mama", "lil' mama", i call him "baby"...

you got spark, you, you got spunk;
you, you got something all the girls want...
you're like a candy store, and i'm a toddler;
you got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
your love, your love... your love, your love...
your love, your love... your love, your love...

mm-hmm... yo... yo...
he the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
just left money gram in the lemon lam...
hot damn, make me scream like summer jam;

anyway, i think i met him in the sky;
when i was a geisha, he was a samurai...
somehow i understood him when he spoke thai;
never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

s-s-s on my chest, let me get my cape on;
he's so thugged out, ghostface and raekwon...
konvict! just like akon,
'cause you know the snitches be putting the jake-on...

you got spark, you, you got spunk;
you, you got something all the girls want...
you're like a candy store, and i'm a toddler;
you got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
your love, your love... your love, your love...
your love, your love... your love, your love...

find me in the dark, i'll be in the stars;
find me in your heart - i'm in need of your love...
your love... your love, your love...
baby, you're the illest...
your love...

your love...

when i was blue, you were blue, you're my smurfette
i put my best chips on the worst bet

girl, i need you like i need air
i never ever, ever thought that i would be scared
of living in a world when you're not there
when you play this song on your macbook
"is that cg, yo, he is old news
i'm way too busy with my new dude."
the best time i ever had
i wish that it was me instead
feeling all your pain
i know that it is different now
it will never be the same but
i swear to god, our love special
you can be my number 2 like one pencil
or you can be my number one, i will let you
in on my life, i've changed so much since you
left, that hotel room
and if you're with another guy, go tell dude
that he can never keep us apart, he needs a better door
he'll always be the guy that you settle for
i'll always be the guy you're s'posed to be with

but trust me my fists are all
full of handfuls of wellbutrin and risperdal
i'm depressed y'all

i'm in nyc or in atl

and i finish this drink that i call a twin tower
two bud lights and a whiskey sour
little kids saying, "there goes my hero!"

hahahaha
uh, they call me the rocker
yo i'm out man


it's childish gambino, y'all know who it is, how it is and what it do
mr. jens lekman on the track, ladies and gentlemen

and the beat go from cool, like plan is to janet, to dammit!
cuties cute in to inspect my go-go gadget
why? 'cause i spit in split time. it's a sign of a double wear prada i'm reachin'
i'm teachin' 'em for a while that you can't deny i'm alive
so existential, my rhymes are quintessential
i'm an educated black and that's a fact. i'm presidential
one riff, and i'm siftin' through n-s lies
got a gift to keep my eyes on the prize, you best move to the side
'cause i'm goin' for the gold, i'm a stone solider
gambino told you jokers that i'm so, so, so foc- i'm so fo-cusssssssed

i'm all grown up, but i'm still childish
it's crazy to think that all them days is behind us
i remember when n-s tried to stop us
now them same n-s on my dick and try for profit
this is what i asked for. it comes with the territory
this isn't a cry for help, ain't no pinnochio story
i'm in it just for the glory - i'm in this to win it, babe
sorry that i came home late

i've been running around the world

i got the empire state now i'm working on the next part
trying to build an empire, i'm wishing on the death star

they make anti-me psa's 'cause i'm dope
and when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative ipod
you just hear 'nope'
on some liz lemon movin' back to cleveland
street lights people, up and down the boulevard
don't stop believin in your journey, and i know it's hard
they call me violet beauregard, 'cause i just blow up, no regard

my light shine bright, no roaches
you the one who eyes wrong
only time i'm worried is when i'm the no-fly zone
'cause i'm so fly, homes
fresh like pinecones
female phone book my iphone
margarita bright, meanin' limelight
let me guess, you know a better rapper, you, right?

bam-b
sicker than your grandma
pass the mix-tape to a friend like chandler
this track is gettin' over written
tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through atlanta
i am at the top
whether you want or not
and i am in my prime
i am an autobot
i do not talk a lot
i am just a rapper

sick

yeah, i stay fly like a pelican
get new kicks everyday like an ottoman
ex-girlfriends askin' if they get a shot again
i try to call 'em back but there's a lot of them
just because i'm rappin' and my style is kinda japanese
band of outsiders
kitsune, apc

i ain't got no jewelry, i leave it at the pawn shop
two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir
you got jacob's jeweler, i got anna wintour
i'd rather spend that money on a polo from la tigra
young, smart, and handsome
who could even ask for more?
i change the situation like auditioning for jersey shore

oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
sick

oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
sick


i do not, i do not, i am just, i am just a rapper

sick boy make moves like a chess piece
and that move real quick like nestle
let me make it clear for a second like pepsi
i was never worried bout my wallet bein' empty
'cause when it was empty, i was still happy
walkin' with my walkman, freestyle rappin'

and this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby
i did this in my bedroom where i separate my laundry
watchin' old episodes of shining time station
why you doing this, what's your motivation?
i am just a rapper, i don't need the paper
no will smith went off without a hitch man
c-h-i-l-d it's the ish man
do sixteen bars no wristband
i'll always be childish, call me maggie simpson
run the track like my tongue's an olympian
i've always been this good, you just weren't listening

i'mma try to make my street cred stack up
gather swagger up, before i take it all
you started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
i can't do one thing, i'm just too good
i can't do one thing, i am tiger woods
i make you ipod hotter than a lighter would

picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
got my fake adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
kid named vincent got it out for me, i hate that guy
frodo from chicago, really small and shy
you better recognize, 'cause i'm no better now
'cause i was always sick, my life's a hospital

i'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing

i'm doing me so big i can hardly walk
these rappers need er like they're charlie park
stay hard like my suit made by tony stark
this kinda music make your balls drop, dick clark
yes i'm grown and sexy, and i'm worth the wait
girls act like i'm the only dude on earth to date
put these words on your head and let them percolate
we need to separate church and state.

i used to have to pay for gas in my momma's saturn
and now i'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
if living my life is what you say you're chasing after


whoa
what'd you get, amnesia?
i bet you wouldn't sleep on me if i was lil' weezy, huh?
bet you wouldn't sleep on me if i was in a band or somethin'
and my bank balance were around a grand or somethin'
do you think i'm common like sense it?
that heaven didn't send this
uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
but you know, i know, i'd make a damn good boyfriend

oil can, oil can
you think i'm the tin man
you took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
ain't you heard i got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
in the mean time don't come crying for the thin man
in the mean time i'll be building my portfolio
all these other dudes eradicated like polio
with any luck you'll see me everywhere like starbucks

i didn't have green like an arizona front lawn
now they try to touch my face like an iphone
now i'm all gassed up like exon
i dunno even know if this girl really likes me
pickin' up the check like i'm workin' at nike
talkin' to this girl and i'm thinkin' that she's into me
then i find out she's tryin' to break in the industry
that's really lame
i still hit it
but i refuse to be home girl's meal ticket
i'm lookin' for a sick girl to be a part of me
not a girl who will try to mccartney me

yes, homie i'm a man of my word
and, yes, these gold diggers tryin' to get at my sperm
well, i'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard
i know my girl out there somewhere
and if you hear this, you should come here
unless you don't give head like a weird beer
elroy, bam-b, yeah, i'm outta here


in the fourth grade i had a crush on tia smith
sixth grade and this crush is turned to beatrice
but they don't like me
because i'm too nice
and i'm kinda fat
and not the dope type

but i grew out of that
and it's a miracle
not every girl sees me as marrying material
it's a buyers market
i'm alicia's target
and every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet

i love these hipster girls
and they feel the same
now they don't have to choose when someone asks them drake or wayne
we didn't have a voice
we used to have to act street but now you've got a choice

my momma's brownie mix
i keep the goodies moist
of every girl i'm tappin
this wasn't supposed to happen
hard to keep my thoughts straight
on every date
especially when my penis talking
swat team, cover me
i'm going in.

i do not talk. i am just a rapper.

yes, i got
i'm meeting other girls
but you don't wanna hear that
and you don't wanna get attached 'cause you'll like me

i'm gonna get mines any means necessary
got red bull pulsing through my pulmonary

met her at a club
now we're making out
and i ain't spend a dub
i'm gonna try to live it up like top floor
and my girls like get so i bought more

all girls 18 and over love this light speed casanova
house pimped out will young sonoma
sleep on me that is a coma

i'm getting at her
i'm hitting that
her kitty cat purred
how weird is that?
i'm digging that

trying to say i don't make mistakes
i'm trying to fix all the hearts i break
but every time that we talk in my apartment
we're gonna kiss a little

you're heartless!
don't call again!
don't email!
we can't be friends!
i swear that this is the end!
then i call her next week
and we do it again.

my girls, my girls, my girls. my girls.
my girls, my girls, my girls, my girls.

i don't mean to seem like i care about material things, like a social status.
i just want four walls and adobe slabs for my girls.

and i have seen a lot of days since, well that's not important
it's been long

and i was feeling whitney, me and my homies zipped to houston
cars and clothes thought i was winning, you knew i was losing
you told me to wake up, oh my clock always stays on snooze and i'm done

to each their own and found peace in knowing
ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
show no emotion, against the cold
and just act as hard as you can

it seems like every plug we needs to utah, became mormons drought comes around, feels like i have no one to depend on
so what, ugh
i put on a little dwight and sang a happy tune and
lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
drank more

to each their own and found peace in knowing
ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
show no emotion, against the cold
and just act as hard as you can
you don't need a friend, boy you're the man


for the 9-6

ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxin, 'cause they be actin' maniac in action
a brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
you looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
my rhyming skills got you climbing hills
i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
i'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more cartoons than animation
my lamination of narration
when i declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring, gazing
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
i'm infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
i'm infinite

bust it, i let the beat commence so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies, i spoil all your fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper then a jeep full of people
mc's are feeble, i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mc's and stand the lonely one
imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
my thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
my accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
that eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
with entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
i'm infinite

man i got evidence i'm never dense and i been clever ever since
so i'm assuming all responsibility
cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill mc's
mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
no one is speacialer, my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
i'd rather let a tactical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
in fact i can't see, or can't imagine
a man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
plus the man who never had a plan b
be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
i'm tensed a bit and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit...
i'm infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it

you know what i'm sayin'?
ayo we got the number one requested song,
of the day, coming up next
it's a local 313 talent
he goes by the name of eminem
and it's called "it's ok"
check it out





one day i plan to be a family man happily married
i wanna grow to be so old that i have to be carried
till i'm glad to be buried
and leave this crazy world
and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
it may be early to be planning this stuff
'cause i'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
cause man it's been rough, but still i manage enough
i've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
my hands have been cuffed
but i don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
i'm anteing up double or nothing, i've been trouble enough
and i'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
my destiny's to rest at ease, till i'm impressed and pleased
with my progress, i won't settle for less than cheese
i'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
way before my baby is able to crawl
i'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
i seen the golden gates to heaven on earth
where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, q


i'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap
praying for sleep
dreaming with a watering mouth
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
in this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
with the root of all evil
i've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
for these grant's and jackson's
these transactions explain a man's actions
but in the mist of this insanity, i found my christianity
through god and there's a wish he granted me
he showed me how to cope with the stress
and hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
to selling dope with the rest
i quit smoking cess to open my chest
life is stressful inside this cesspool
trying to wrestle, i almost bust a blood vessel
my little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
he's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
kids attract static, children with automatics
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets
i'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
i won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
it's cumbersome, i'm trying to do well on this earth
but it's been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth


uh, it's ok, yeah it's all right, even though i can't sleep
uh yeah, it's ok, it's all right, i can't sleep


none of these skills you bout to see come free
so you wanna be a sweet mc, you gotta become me
if you ever wanna be one see

none of these skills you bout to see come free
so you wanna be a sweet mc, you better become me
if you ever wanna be one see

yo some people say i'm whack, now if that's right
i'm the freshest whack mc that you ever heard, in your lifetime
my slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
boy i'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
forgot a gold digger's succubus, my souls thick with ruggedness
i got more different strokes than philip drummound
we elevated to new heights premeditated
let it be that i stated they hate it now that they see that i made it
the escalated can be put to the test of greatness
snatch the heart from mc's and i ate it
so i take it that's the reason i'm hated
to represent my temperament
if rap was a dick all you so called hard mc's would not be impitant
everything that you collaborate i lacerate
my rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
at a faster rate, yeah i got something for your ass to hate
i blasterate, and have you all running master gates
and as for face clutching and touching the flows
i got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
defiance, no we won't have that
well i'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
then bring them some of this real hip-hop
i drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
and you all knew from meeko
that you couldn't hold your own with the strength of lou forigno

ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

i'm getting mad love, i'm snuggling hugs
druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
so here's a toast to federal checks
hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
we travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
to find babbling max, gaffling tracks
i grapple an axe for them baffling acts
the mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
still in my yard when i sculpted the culprit
then i buried the hatchet, i carried the fat chick
butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
baby all i wanna do is swallow one and two
smoke a little bit and follow one of you
back home when the party ends
to the finest women in the audience

they honor the

we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right

ayo, spiders are like tarantulas, vandealous
living as scandalous as a television evangelist
but i can handle this, i'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
i think a living never meant for me
experimentally i found a way to spread interamentally
when i stumbled upon this resolution
by using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
you couldn't see me with binoculars
i armed like an octopus
step on stage and you get socked and pushed
talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
when i rap i represent it and will never referee in it
every minute so when i win it you never resent it
i'm forever demented, come up with funk, i'll never be scented
you got the point when i cleverly said it


we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right

eminem is heading skyward
for those who thought that i would make you bored
and treat you like a piece
of plywood
i've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous
i rap for all you draculas and showed you all how whack you was
i meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
i'm hazardous enough already as it is
without you adding fuel to the fire
i'm cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
clinical studies show that i'm cynical
there's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
i'm sure the party people can agree
that i'm enchanting, with the romantic
freaking the vocals so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like


we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling all right




i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine
she tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
plus she got a sugar daddy
asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
if you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
you're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
when you step away son, she got her face done
looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
you press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
but when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
to go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
don't bring your germs to me, 'cause i ain't trying to hear it

sometimes i wonder, what's your purpose? in life that is
you say it's gonna stop but it... just... slows... down
and then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
you say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

i met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
so i stepped on it and then asked my homies
big game over there and take notes, while i get this number
turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
and said "oh it's like that?"
she said her name was maxine, so i told her i wanted her number
she asked could i give her mine two
got to the crib and called her up
i said "maxine check this out,
give me your address i'll be through and you'll find out"
got to the crib she let me in
she didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
i said "hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
so i went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
as she went for my midsection
i threw her down as i tore off her shirt
pulled out my jimmy and i thought about putting in work
before i hit it she said
"3 don't get mad but there's something that i gotta tell your ass"
she said "no i forgot to tell you, that i got aids"
i got up out



hey yo, what's up man? hey, yo you been here all day man

i'll have you taken back to christ when you're sacrificed
the way you're hacked and sliced when i fill your back with knives
jacking lives of mc's, now i'm set to launch a plan
for blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
i stomped your man so unless you want what he got
you best just set the mic down, i'm steaming like a teapot
i'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
if i wanna battle, then i chase them in a jason mask
it's an amazing task to battle with success
and in a slug fest i get physical like physicians
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
so feel the force of my spiritual images
slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
my skin itches every time a rapper recites
and when he's through with his verse, i'm all covered in flea bites
you wanna see fights i got a match for you

point him out man i wanna know

you wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
intellectually superior, i'll make the whack wearier
inferior, deteriorate, like bacteria
materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
how much in fear when you hear me you'll be, and
shiver and shake, quiver and quake
bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache, wither and break
you slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
i'll twist you into a different shape
and toss you in michigan lake, for fishermen's sake
if this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
every diss you can take, personal
we ain't friends trying to make amends
i make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
your last releases, you pass diseases, that's the reason
i'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
so pass it like a hot potato
i've never been less than clever and fresh
severing flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

point him out man i wanna know
point him out! i wanna know
ayo let me get that mic man'

ain't no one special, special like you

i'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
missing what i remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
bugging and weezing, i'm having trouble when breathing
it's even tougher when sleeping
but there's a couple of reasons that i'm suffering and grieving
for loving and leaving, you're all i'm thinking of in the evening
you got my knees buckling and weakening
thoughts of nothing but freaking that i'm struggling to keep in
and interrupt when i'm speaking
i got some game that i'm preparing to run
the way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
cause your comparing to none, i wanna share in the fun
i feel a passionate lust when i'm imagining just us alone at last with a
touch
i see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
the seed is passing in dust
i'm not asking to rush and answer me immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
'cause i just need you to see, how much i'm eager to be
your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
this is easily said, so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down cause ain't nobody like you no where to be found


baby it's all on you, it's you i call on boo
let's set a day up so you can fall on through
we'll take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
we'll start it out with caviar, don parigne
and then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
we'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
i got the herbs the bacardi and hurricane
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
it's still all right 'cause i got minute maid and tangeray
your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
you look impeccable, nothing compares
i dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
when you step away, baby but don't forget the neglicie



attention all units, attention all units
we have an all points bulletin out on a man with green hair
i repeat, we have an apb on a man with green hair
he's armed with a knife, i repeat, he's armed with a knife
proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
he could be coming at your girlfriend next

there's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
his face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
he'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
he's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
he's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks

i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he ain't no good!

we got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
locking down every block and put up metal detectors
protectors and be sure that you stand close
watch each others backs and guard your command post
and most of all be advised that he's wise
he could be disguised as one of your very own guys

i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he ain't no good!

i'm on a solo mission to find him personally
to settle the score and beat then him mercifully
for what he first did to me
it's sure to be the last
following footprints with a magnifying glass
to drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
i'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
i heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"give me your girlfriend or i'm gonna kill ya"

i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he ain't no good!

i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
inside the depths of his basement
i taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place' went!
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
none of my guys knew where i'm at i was doomed
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume

i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he ain't no good!

dealing with backstabber's there was one thing i learned
they're only powerful when you got your back turned
i yearned for the day that we finally met again
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine
he shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
beating him over the head with the telephone

attention all cars, attention all cars
unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
he's going back to the crazy home, i repeat
he's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he ain't no good!
i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he ain't no good!
i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughtta
why i oughtta
stay away from him he ain't no good!



jealous!?! what he mean jealous, know what i'm saying?
he just mad 'cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what i'm saying?
girls don't buy him no clothes, he bought that ho some clothes!
i mean, what do i got to be jealous for?
he ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
he has no career move, i mean...

i come home every single day from working double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only squabble only irrelevant issues
too many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings you say i'm bad at timing things
so what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
i used to love your company now you always bugging me
for information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
so i'ma wait for your evacuation
cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see i've never been so sure, and your just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check them in
look at the nervous wreck i'm in, i need my second wind, say what?


me and eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
jealous of me, know what i'm saying? that's what i'm talking about

i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
i used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
until the day i started following your feetprints
and tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
it made complete sense, there's someone else you like
so i confronted you and asked you who was mike?
someone rich that i could follow
and you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
leaving me in sorrow, brandy never felt so broken hearted
i fell apart when you departed then the joking started
i was an open target, you play comedian
and i became the laughing stock. but now i'm on my feet again
and so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
all in my sex life, i got a message from phife
he goes, "you didn't want me to see you then, i don't want you now"
take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
you run me down and now your trying to apologize
for all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
jealousy is in the house y'all, fellas sing it...



"eminem!"

"no!"

"eminem!"

"no!"


"what do you want from me?!"

"remember me?"

"i killed you!"

"you thought i was dead, didn't you?"

"what do you want from me!?"

"i'm alive!"

"oh, my god!"

"get up."

"no!"

"get up and look in the mirror."

"i don't want to!"

"look in the mirror, to see your reflection."

"leave me alone!"

"look in the mirror --- you're nothing! you're nothing without me!



you see this bullet hole in my neck? it's self inflicted
arrested, molested myself and got convicted
wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
i'm dr. hyde and mr. jekyl
disrespectful
hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
"murder murder redrum"
brain size of a bread crumb
which drug will i end up dead from
inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
use to let the babysitter suck my dick when i was little'er
sniper, waiting on your roof like the fiddler
y'all thought i was gonna rhyme with riddler

i'm low down and i'm shiftee
and if you hear a man that sounds like me smack'em

i lace tunes, i'm out this world like space moons
with a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
doing whippits, passed out like sanford snippits
where's the weed, i wanna tamper with it
i'ma let your grandpa hit it
mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what i'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
losing all of my leverage
went up inside the first national bank broke, and left rich
walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
smoked out like?
band just making my neck itch
you just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
slap hips, support domestic violence
i'm just joking, is dirty dozen's really dust smoking?

my head's ringing, like it was spider sense tingling
i'm out the game, put the second string in
this brandy got my swinging
bobbing back and forth like a penguin
delinquent, toking microphones with broken english
make your mama be like "oh! this is good! who sing this?"
"slim shady, his tape is dope, i love it
it was predicted by a medic
i'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
living off liquid triametic
pathetic, but i don't think this headache's ever vanishing
panicing, i think i might have just took too much anasin
frozen manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
i think i'm dying, god is that you?
somebody help me, before i od on an lp
take me to er asap for and iv
they say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is tupac
it's politics, it's all a fix
setup by these white blue collared hicks
just to make a dollar off of black music
with a subliminal ball of tricks
but those can kiss ass and swallow dicks


life; by marshall mathers.
what is life?
life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down, and every time you think you gotten past it, it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground.
what are friends?
friends are people that you think are your friends, but they really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide they true colors.
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers, they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'.
what is money?
money is what makes a man act funny.
money is the root of all evil.
money'll make them same friends come back around, swearing that they was always down!
what is life?
i'm tired of life!

i'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
i'm tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
tired of not having a deal
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
i'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wonders why i'm smartin' off
i'm tired of being fired every time i fart and cough
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
i'm tired of using plastic silverware
tired of working in building square, tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
i'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, 'cause i'd still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have one on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm, tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
i'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on "nobody's as ill as me"
i'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of jlb saying "where hip-hop lives"

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
i'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, 'cause i'd still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

you know what i'm saying?
telling me to be positive?
you know what i'm sayin'?
right now i'm tired of everything!
tired of all this playa hating that's going on in my own city, can't get no airplay, you know what i'm sayin'?
but hey, it's cool though, you know what i'm sayin'?
just fed up!
that's my word!


whoa!
a get your hands in the air, and get to clappin' 'em
and like, back and forth because ah

i be the f-r-o the double g *coughing*
and check out the man he goes by the name of er...

slim shady, brain dead like jan brady
i'm a m80, you lil' like that kim lady
i'm buzzin', dirty dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
cursin' at you players worse than marty schottenheimer
you ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
i'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
i have a disease and they don't know what to call it
better hide your wallet cause i'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
the proof is in the puddin', just ask the deshaun holton

so when you see me on your block with two glocks
tellin' your boys that i'm on crack

so put my tape back on the rack
but see me on the street and duck
'cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed

i'm nicer than pete, but i'm on a search to crush a milkbone
i'm everlasting, i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
i'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make your freak leave you, smell the folgers crystals
this is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols

come on hey hey we goin' to the beach
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
where's mama?
she's takin' a little nap in the trunk
oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk
it's kind of late to go swimmin'
but you know your mama she's one of those types of women
who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it
and don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful?
don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle?
and mama said she wants to show how far she can float
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
it's just a little scratch it don't hurt
her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?


there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
a place called prison and a place called jail
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, i'll explain it to ya
but for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
but i still feel sad that i put her in time out
sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out
i told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba?
humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty
you're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 bonnie and clyde, me and my daughter


wake up sleepy head we're here
before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the pier
baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear
that's why you can't get her to wake
but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the lake
here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock?
we'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock
ready now, here we go, on the count of three
one, two, three... weeeeeeeeee
there goes mama splashin' in the water
no more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order
no more step dada, no more new brother
blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her
we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

while your whole crew treat us like g's, you best believe this

while the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
i'm like two-face, i'm painful to rappers then you can tell
from these shells, how i gotta bend 'em like route canals
i erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials
horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
everything is foul when swift's around, vacate now
i'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild

it's swifty from the 313
like i said no one is iller than me, unnhh!

fuzz

still on probation for stranglin' my boy jason
should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 i'm facin'
last week this old man i had to blast
'cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
didn't realize it was my grandmother till i checked her pocketbook
better explain where the hell your tvs and vcrs is at
i done lost 100 pounds, i ain't been eatin' like i should
this wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "everybody get out"!
my girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
'cause she found out i was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece

no one, no one's iller than me

i'm on my seventh 8-ball, now i gotta take a piss
i'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
i'm always takin' someone else's girl like cool j does
they probably don't be packin' anyways, do they fuzz?
we walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
mics get sandblasted
stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in saran plastic
get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
flashin' in front of your face without the grand masters

slim shady, ain't nobody iller than me

fuzz
massive lead to leave your cabbage red
similar to your ass in a casket dead
drastic spread of acid heads
come to abort you like a bastard egg
that trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
ask the feds from past the edge
rockin' the most classic threads
flashin' bread, roll down the window
you can get till that ass get red
bizarre you get him and him, swift you get him and him
never writer's block, i block writers
my block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
and got drop kicked, now she screamin' "stop it..."
i shoot a rocket through your optic
i got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
grab the green from al by showin' him hot grits

ain't nobody iller than me

bizarre
it's the mr. fuzzy from the 313
no one, no one is iller than me
it's eminem and swift from the 313
no one, no one is iller than me
it's fuzz and buzz-arre from the 313

you have now witnessed 4 ill emcees!
from the home of potholes and trash
we'll lyrically blast...


all i see is murder murder, my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder, my mind state
murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

all i see is murder murder, my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder, my mind state
murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
and for what your life's worth this money is twice that
grab a couple grand and lay-up in iceland
see i'm a nice man but money turned me to satan
i'm thirsty for this green so bad i'm dehydratin'
shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
i want the whole pie, i won't be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin', clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description an' sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
but i ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'cause i got a daughter to feed
and $200 ain't enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell an' hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
then i slammed her on her back till her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin' "freeze!"
but i'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
and a bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin' bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots, they bust back
hit me square in the chest, i wasn't wearin' a vest...

all i see is murder murder, my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder, my mind state
murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

all i see is murder murder, my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder, my mind state
murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
pulled the mac-10 out and stuck it in her face
shut ya yackin' mouth before i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair, smacked her up
stole her car, made a profit
grabbed a tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl on set it off did
jetted off kid, stole the whip, now i'm a criminal
drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but i'm injured badly though
parents screamin', "johnny, go in and call the police.
tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
smashed the window, grabbed the nintendo 64
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
there goes the cheese, eggs, milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped, must o' been some dumb-luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i must o' dropped the beanie baby
surrendered my weapon to cops.
"wasn't me! it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint schnopps."

all i see is murder murder, my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder, my mind state
murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

all i see is murder murder, my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
all i see is murder murder, my mind state
murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!



life... by marshall mathers
what is life?
life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
and every time you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends?
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
what is money?
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
what is life?
i'm tired of life
i'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
i'm tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
tired of not having a deal
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
i'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why i'm smartin off
i'm tired of being fired every time i fart and cough
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
i'm tired of using plastic silverware
tired of working in building square
tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because i'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

i'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
i'm tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have it on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm, tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
in the back of a contour
i'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
i'm tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on "nobody's as ill as me"
i'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of j-l-b saying "where hip-hop lives"

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because i'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

you know what i'm saying?
telling me to be positive
know what i'm sayin'?
know what i'm sayin'? right now i'm tired of everything
tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
can't get no airplay, you know what i'm sayin'?
but hey, it's cool though, you know what i'm sayin'?
just fed up wid it
that's my word y'all

my brain's dead weight, i'm tryin' to get my head straight
and dr. dre said, "slim shady you a basehead!"
uh-uh! "then why's your face red? man, you wasted!"

well, since age twelve, i've felt like i'm someone else
'cause i hung my original self, from the top bunk with a belt
got pissed off, and ripped pamela lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard, i knocked her clothes backwards like kris kross

i smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass


my english teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high

i smacked him in his face with an eraser

walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup

my english teacher wanted to have sex in junior high, the only problem was, my english teacher was a guy

extra-terrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians, while they screamin' "let's just be friends!


narrator

but on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
and suddenly, his conscience comes into play.

dr. dre
of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
you'd better think of the consequence

eminem
that's nonsense.
go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
if you shave your legs with renee's razor blades

dr. dre
yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
the whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you.
think about it, before you walk in the door first.
look at the store clerk, she's older then george burns.

eminem

dr. dre
don't even listen to slim, yo. he's bad for you.

eminem
you know what, dre? i don't like your attitude.


narrator
meet stan, 21 years old.
after meeting a young girl at a rave party,
thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
once again, his conscience comes into play.

eminem
smearin' her lipstick,
i slip this in her drink.

dr. dre
yo, this girl's only 15 years old.
you shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair.

eminem
till she passes out and she forgot how she got there.

dr. dre
man, ain't you ever seen that one movie kids?

eminem
no, but i seen the porno with son doobiest!

dr. dre

after coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.

dr. dre
alright, calm down. relax, start breathin'.

eminem
while you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?

dr. dre

eminem
what? she tripped? fell? landed on his dick?

dr. dre
alright, shady.
maybe he's right, grady.
but think about the baby,
before you get all crazy.

eminem
okay! thought about it. still wanna stab her?
grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her
that's what i did. be smart, don't be a retard.
you gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes!?

dr. dre
what'd you say?

eminem
what's wrong? didn't think i'd remember?

dr. dre

eminem
ah-ah, temper, temper!
mr. dre? mr. n.w.a.? mr. ak
coming straight outta compton, y'all better make way?

dr. dre
'cuz he don't need to go the same route that i went.
been there, done that.
shoot 'em both, grady, where's your gun at?
*gunshots*


scalpel
sponge
wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing

these are the results of a thousand electric volts
a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
and i might snap, one day just like that
i decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
my first day in junior high, this kid said
"it's you and i, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
he said, "don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
my palms were sweaty, and i started to shake at first
something told me, "try to fake a stomach ache it works"
i screamed, "ow, my appendix feels like they could burst
teacher, teacher, quick i need a naked nurse"
oh, i mean it is, but i also got a bum knee
and just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework)
but don't you wanna give me after school detention?

brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'
but everywhere i go they keep playin' my song

brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'
but everywhere i go they keep playin' my song
brain damage

way before my baby daughter hailey
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named d'angelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin'
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him, "we shouldn't beef"
but he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said, "you gonna die honkey"
and started helpin' him stomp me
i made them think they beat me to death
holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
"this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i'm gettin' you back bully, now once and for good"
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it till i broke the wood
knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
made it home, later that same day
started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryna to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin', "what are you on, drugs?
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'
but everywhere i go they keep playin' my song

brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'
but everywhere i go they keep playin' my song
brain damage

it's brain damage
i got brain damage
it's brain damage
it's probably brain damage
it's brain damage

i got brain damage
it's brain damage


em, what's goin' on, this is paul rosenberg, your faithful attorney at law.
listen, i listened to the rough copy of your album and uhh, you know i just gotta be honest with you.
could you tone it down a little bit, because there's only so much i can explain.
gimme a call.


life; by marshall mathers.
what is life?
life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down, and every time you think you gotten past it, it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground.
what are friends?
friends are people that you think are your friends, but they really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide they true colors.
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers, they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'.
what is money?
money is what makes a man act funny.
money is the root of all evil.
money'll make them same friends come back around, swearing that they was always down!
what is life?
i'm tired of life!

i'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
i'm tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
tired of not having a deal
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
i'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wonders why i'm smartin' off
i'm tired of being fired every time i fart and cough
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
i'm tired of using plastic silverware
tired of working in building square, tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
i'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, 'cause i'd still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have one on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm, tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
i'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on "nobody's as ill as me"
i'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of jlb saying "where hip-hop lives"

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
i'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, 'cause i'd still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

you know what i'm saying?
telling me to be positive?
you know what i'm sayin'?
right now i'm tired of everything!
tired of all this playa hating that's going on in my own city, can't get no airplay, you know what i'm sayin'?
but hey, it's cool though, you know what i'm sayin'?
just fed up!
that's my word!


just the two of us


c'mon hai-hai, we goin' to the beach
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
oh where's mama? she's takin' a little nap in the trunk
now i know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
but you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
and don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
and mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
it's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
mama's messy isn't she? we'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?


see honey, there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
a place called prison and a place called jail
and dada's probably on his way to all of them except one
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better i'll explain it to ya
but for now we'll just say mama was real, real bad
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
but i still feel sad that i put her on time-out
i told you it's okay hai hai, wanna ba-ba?
her make poo-poo ca-ca? dada change your dia-dee
your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 bonnie and clyde, me and my daughter


wake up, sweepy head, we're here
before we pway, we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
that's why you can't get her to wake
but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
we'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
ready now, here we go, on the count of free
one, two, free, whee
there goes mama, spwashin' in the water
no more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
no more step-dada, no more new brother
now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk


just the two of us

your dada will always be there for you
your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
if you ever need me i'mma always be here for you
if you ever need anything, just ask
dada will be right there
your dada loves you
i love you baby


*girl talking on phone*
justin, its zoe, um kellie did not have me call you
however i just listened to eminem in her car
it is the most disgusting thing i have ever heard
in my entire life and i seriously want to call his
it like makes me upset, i am now nauseous and i cant eat lunch
goodbye


ok, i'm going to attempt to drown myself.
you can try this at home.
you can be just like me.
mic check 1 2, we recordin'?

i'm cancerous,
so when i diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for canibus
i'll strangle you to death, then i'll choke you again
take you on jerry springer and beat your ass legally!
i get too blunted off of funny home grown
so if i said i never did drugs,
hillary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
my nerves hurt, and lately i'm on edge
every girl i ever went out with is goin' les'
smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
i'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
so i'm dumb enough to ask a for date with lauryn hill
some people only see that i'm white, ignoring skill
'cause i stand out like a green hat with an orange bill
but i don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
i get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave,
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger won't go down, how do i wave?
and this is how i'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

now follow me and do exactly what you see
don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
i slap women and eat shrooms, then o.d.
now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?

me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
my mind won't work
if my spine don't jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
i'm not a player just an ill rhyme-sayer
my rap style's warped
i'm runnin' out the morgue
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn
with an acorn
i'm about as normal as norman bates
with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
"mother, are you there? i love you!
will someone please explain
to my brain
that i just severed a main vein
with a chainsaw and i'm in pain?
i take a breather and sigh, either i'm high
or i'm nuts, 'cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer
shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious i got it on with her
i bought cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it

i came to the club drunk and with a fake id
don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
i've been with 10 women who got hiv
now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
i got genital warts and it burns when i pee
don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
i tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
you probably wanna grow up the just like me!


i'll tell you what i don't believe in, can i do that?
all right, i don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever
i try not to obey them at any time
that's what i believe in, not believing in
four big bottles of water a day, two packs of marlboro reds and
music, i have to listen to music all day long
i say that keeps me going
i'm a pretty dark person, i've thought about ending it a million times
and i have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing

thank you
sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
and still i come up clever, i just need to free my thoughts
and lord knows that i know better, but i ain't perfect
i ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
you should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead, die trying and know death
might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
i mean that from the bottom of my heart
you see my art is all i have, and victory tastes sweet
even when the enemy can throw salt
let bygones be bygones, but where i'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
my uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight
that's why i'm shaking my head when you rap dissing
my stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
i start evaluating, then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
and this is compton, lions in the land of the triumph
wrap saran our defiance, ban our alliance
put burners in the hands of the black man
one hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned kobe bryant
you probably heard i wanna be heard and wonder who i am
you probably even listen to "faith" and think i know zion
but really i'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
i got a big fear of flying
my future so bright i'd probably go blind before i blink twice, i ain't lying
i swear to god half of y'all just don't know kendrick
the school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
you walking down the block, he got shot, you wouldn't know i witnessed
you just mind your bidness
you just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennises
it's kinda scary ain't it
just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?
cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him
so much, you probably had your burner tucked in graduation
said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing
twenty-five to life with a murder charge
your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to god
i pray these bars get farther than compton
and if my record never break i still won't break my promise, i promise to keep it honest
secret society, all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come
and i'm like, the kendrick lamar o.d. in less than a month
all right? gotta keep it pushing
can't let the government tell me how my future looking
i'm on rosecrans and central trying to duck the central bookings
i've been a warrior when i came out of my mom's placenta
in the gutter lane like i'm master splinter
how splendid, i guess my project had did it
they said seven tracks, i said fifteen
called it an ep, they said i'm tripping
but little did they know, i'm tryna change the rules
that we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions
killing our dreams, stealing our vision
out in haiti adolescents barely have a home
who we hanging with, and bragging about the iphone
i swear to god, most y'all cats just don't know kendrick
you barely know yourself, so i guess most of y'all should be offended
ain't doing this for my health, i'm just trying to purchase my momma them businesses
occupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's
just to coincide, just to go inside, books we idolize while we living
look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to mastermind

we would like to call this an appreciation tape
for those who recognized the kendrick lamar ep
for this is the kendrick lamar o.d.
because of you, we are overly dedicated


where are we going? why are we slowing down?
where are you going? we should be growing now


that's what she said to me
that place i used to call home is just a bed to me
and we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
meanwhile i'm in these streets with everybody
i'm trying to get it and she know they got me, i watch her feelings watch me
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
look each other in the face and barely blink
i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
so if my letters don't reach you, i hope these lyrics in sync

that's what it said to me
but that place i call ambition now dead to me
gone and forgotten, i'm off track like dale earnhardt
my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
balling out, but i'm bout to drop the ball
i'm calling out for help, my engineer called
told me come to the studio, i wanna tell him nah

that's what he said to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me
only a hundred and forty-four can go
seven billion people on planet earth today
is there something that i don't know?
i know to follow him, rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means i'm following evil
guess i'm following evil, i should follow cathedral
blessings i need, but live like i don't need you

so in conclusion
we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
so to what's important in my life, i apologize
i promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is, would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
would you not know how to act or take action? it's just a part of life

i'm trying to visualize how to get it right
but my vision's so blurry
trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground
but we're always in a hurry now
and if i could make this world stand a little slower
then i would, then we could grow a little closer
i think we're getting closer
i think we're getting closer


i remember, uh
all my uncles, sir smokers
on the landra, in front of our building
they was my heroes


uh, and that's scary to me
dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
especially when sounwave is on his ps
don't fast forward, i'ma serve you some +keys+
this is crack cocaine, i'm kurt cobain
and i bang like a c-r-i-p
p-r-i-u, high you, i'm an i-v
i said an i-v 'cause when i be
in the studio, high shot, a needle in your vein
take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
i'm cold on the cold turkey, i hate chickens
over the pyrex where my world at

uh, and that's scary to me
every listener is a strawberry to me
disease on k-dot? uh uh, better wake up
curl up like big worm when i drop
who fly? i'm a red eye with eyedrops
i big, i 'pac, you chris, i +rock+
that's pookie hom', new jack head-first with a cyclops
i'm the first one to do that, i bet you never knew that
back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
if it ain't about me, about hoe
or be about face if you ain't no higher, learn it
there's soda in the pot and the fire, burning

uh, and it's scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of merlot
that'll freak y'all out like a girl virgo
when i turbo on any track it's a reynolds wrap
you could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet, i suppose
this is bigger than life
this is probably everybody illuminatis
guess i'm the blood sacrifice
of the party, i undress her like a harley
lights will flash, cars will crash
smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
so my bad if i put you in rehab
you are reimbursed, put it on my, tab



"gina, baby, i don't have no money, and i don't have no ends
"i'm going through something right now"
"i told you that"

oh, what up hoe? oh, what up?
i said, oh, what up hoe? oh, what up?
i said, oh, what up hoe? oh, what up?
well all right

i'm going through something with life

welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
i want diamonds too, ronnie on player's club
i used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on rosecrans
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louie's burgers
hold my tears, i tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
maintaining my modest-modest as i dream


"so what you wish me over here for?
how was your day?
are you tipsy?"
mhmm

give me that, won't you give that? once again it's on
coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
where your friends at? i got long dick, what it is
go on poke it out, situate your little positives
how i live? big shot, on my grind, all ready
i'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
when you let me, when you let me...

give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
i can't get enough
if i offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
i can't get enough
if i offend you...

uh, i wrote this song when dave drove home
and it made me think when another car blinked
to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the ever-hard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow
your car now due and you bout to get evicted
but still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign

okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should i begin?
finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
crackers watch my every step, man i hate to work for them
and here i am, stressing, questioning my direction man
what to do? nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
'soul, balls deep, ya dig?
retrieve relief, ya dig?
let's kill a bottle of tequila
and lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
cause all i've been thinking the whole day...

give me that, won't you give that? once again it's on
coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
where your friends at? i got long dick, what it is
go on poke it out, situate your little positives
how i live? big shot, on my grind, all ready
i'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
when you let me, when you let me...


she look better than beyonce, alicia keys, halle berry, miss jolie
where's she from? no i.d., that girl's an alien
and if i die before i wake, i pray that i'm in outer space
u-f-o fly away
so let's go-go-go-go, let's go-go-go-go
let's go-go-go-go, let's go, let's go

uh, she got me going, i'm all in
fifty stories, i'm falling
where you been? is it planet mars?
far beyond the stars? are you a martian?
you're unfamiliar, but still i feel ya
energy is sending me toward the ceiling
i'm high now, are you up there?
if you was, i would climb every other stair
i gotta stare, i mean wow
and i'm wowed, no one compares
a one-on-one, you must have won
every pageant in america when you was young
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop

uh, so now we on, so now we gone
living in the city of the unknown
i show her off, i stunt with her
we do it sweet, they look bitter
look at her get up, i hear 'em say
but why him? i hear 'em hate
i laugh at it, rather than jab at it
then continue eternal life as a crack addict
'cause i'm addicted, and you the drug
cold turkey? no sir
gotta be an odyssey from heaven way above
you definite, not probably, i gotta give it up
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop

you something different
i'm glad i found you
so pretty
i'll never do anything to hurt you



uh
we hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people...
i'm inspired, so get inspired

and so he said, why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
why you couldn't be a con-artist? why you couldn't
why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started?
why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
why you let me use yours 'cause i don't got mines?
why you always lift me up when i'm completely giving up?
why you giving me your last, knowing you ain't got it?
why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
why you tell me that you love me? why you always thinking of me?
want my company rather than going club hopping
why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
why you making promises that you'll forever do?
whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you, sometimes

we hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
nothing in common, it ain't fair
but where do we seem to fall?
where do we seem to fall?
tender love and care, once upon a time
once upon a time, we was there)

and so she said, why you gotta be so mean to me?
why you don't know what you mean to me?
why you always playing games? why i feel like you ashamed
out in public, curse me out and make a scenery?
why text messages popping up saying hi daddy?
why you treat me like i'm nothing? why you always at a function?
i be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me
why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
why you always assuming that i still love my ex?
every time we get into it, i'm the one that's feeling stupid
you don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat
why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
why i feel i'm the last option after your homies?
why you always gotta know that i will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me? sometimes

she says she loves me, she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when i want to be left alone
but she's beautiful
like sometimes when i have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice, she says when i give her a cue
she says she loves me
like when i wake up in the morning
she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
she says she needs me, she says she loves me
or like when i'm stepping out of the shower
she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
she says, she says she loves me
so instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says, she says she loves me
and i don't know about love


i used to want to be like michael jordan
figured i would hit the nba and make me a fortune

used to clean my rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
bumping "me against the world", hello world, kendrick here
wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
michael jordan
bounce-bounce hoe, bounce-bounce

pull up on them twenty-sixes, i'm a vanity slave
i'm a sinner, jesus christ, please forgive me for my ways
i'm a comp-town representer, concrete backflipper
this is hiiipower, since the eddie bower i've been popular
i'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come
you jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping though?
we stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? you should learn from 'em
see too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming

used to clean my rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
bumping "me against the world", hello world, kendrick here
wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes

man, the game chose me, what am i to do?
only thing i did wrong was make it possible
i diddy bop and make them titties pop
out there on my bumper like a city cop
walking down to fred segal, put my girl on it
ass so fat, probably sit the world on it
man, i know i can't tell you 'bout the world homie
but i know i can tell you bout your girl homie
i know they pay me, too much of attention
bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
i need me an engine that go real fast
call it "haul of fame", once it haul ass
give me tall glass, coconut ciroc
please no soda pop, i make my solo pop

i remember tripping, walking through the set like my glock don't think
grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
you chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
your broad that chose, yes she moving on, yep we do it wrong
you know i'm gone, turn my swagger on, am i swagged enough?
leaning off the actavis, passing blunts round and round
work her bouncing on my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
you let it slide, i hit home-runs, clean her dugout till i'm done
i can be her number two and you can be her number one


lord forgive me

kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand
then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block
and blam i ain't backing down for nothing
i'm a back 'em down like shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man
police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner,
coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,
the next morning high toasted up with my homies
we drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? uh-huh
you see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in compton
ask me what i have accomplished
i don't know i don't have conscience
i just load up and start dumpin' on enemies i'm head hunting
no sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
protect ya neck 'cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
cause ignorance is bliss

and i'm this far, from a discharge but never will i dish off
we all tryna ball and when i got the rock i'll dish off
until the day i pistol whip you posers till y'all pissed off
then peel off, in a hooptie
indubitably i'm too street
indubitably i'm a do me
and i'm good
i'll make an album that'll put a smile on malcolm
make martin luther tell god i'm the future for heaven's talent
not only from the rap game, i'm including the planet
cats so watered down clowns can sink titanic
tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
die young, corpse identified by your parents
apparently you a parrot
mocking me and my blueprint
but i won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
stop it, i'm hearin' the comments
the critics are calling me conscious
but truthfully, every shooter be callin' me compton
so truthfully, only calling me kweli and common?
proves, that ignorance is bliss

and i'm this far, from a discharge but never will i dish off
this my world, i grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these california earthquakes hit so hard
i'm so-cal, you so called
rappers need to go call
ghostbusters to shoot busters i'm casper when i go off
i show up, to show out to show off
you a hundred percent behind me
and if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
i remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
backin' down boggins
we gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
you gon' tip her
cause ignorance is bliss
and willy b i'm a fool on yo beats, i bleed out the speaker
as the speaker that spoke when they done speak



like should i start trapping? if what i write down
don't connect this very moment, then i'm on it, no question
do i cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some e?
oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when i sleep?
this is deep as the abyss, i'm not just rhyming on the beat
i be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
this is me frustrated, battling my own evils
finna saddle up that work, across ohio in a geo
or should i sell my music .zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
rather records on the needle, making music
clocking fast bank like a shot from patrick ewing
i'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
especially when your homies pushing v8 hinges
twenty-two on twenty-sixes, range rovers rolling up
three-fifty for an ounce of fire, i hope i got enough
this industry calling my bluff, i need a new solution
curve-serving, know i might be in your store boosting
don't wanna be pun, don't wanna be b.i.g., don't wanna be 'pac
just give me your funds, a.k.a. everything that you got
or everything getting shot, for nothing
leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
then expand to the hoover dam, water
sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
i disperse to the world of unruly, where i put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
you'll know i always had a passion for riddle when writing
but lately i've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially, so please don't be mad at me

there are times, when you need someone
i will be by your side
oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
special for you, and me yeah
i-take-i-take-take my chances-chances-chances
before they pass, they pass, they pass
pass me by, oh darling
you've got to look at the other side

r.o.t.c., or right on time conscience


one time
reporting live, compton, california

have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
like you never get right? sort of like a black sheep
back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
i struck enough pain, let her know i wasn't playing
and back, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five
and if i survive i probably wouldn't sell it
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto, rather in some heals like giuseppe's
they want me unemployed, until i hit the streets
for filling voids of broke d-boys selling weed
b.b. king or the neighbors of snoop

they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say i can't live comfortable
i'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past
{we are, we are fighters
we are, we are true
through the, through barbed wires
we will, will break through}
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past

have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
like you never did right? sort of like a black sheep
tryna get away from the world stereotype
barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
she desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
she gon' have a baby, then flee from her education
at the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes
see a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
she will never get by, no how, no way
welfare recipient, property of the state
housing, section 8, corner store, prostitute
hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
chilling in pajamies, waiting on the first
fast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur

they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say she can't live comfortable
she gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so while she up in v.i.p. pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past
{we are, we are fighters
we are, we are true
through the, through barbed wires
we will, will break through}
so while she up in v.i.p. pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past

have you ever felt like you finally got life?
you finally got right? no longer a black sheep
of a convertible, eloping to get married
what a feeling of overcoming the odds
it's like you just hit the lottery, my god
there must be a god, cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling, ali
now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
making good decisions, got an independent business mind
and both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way
just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
but they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
you must have joined the illuminati just to ball out

they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say they can't live comfortable
they gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad
know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path

just laugh, then everybody say

'cause i won't get caught again
and i'm here to start the trend
you can't catch me if you try

"so you made it past all the barbed wires?"


the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
that's the hardest thing

on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
with that being said, each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head, i needed survival
got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
and i don't even push a line, i'm just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said you're judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider, that if it goes down
so if you ask what i'm doing
i'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and

but one thing you should consider, i'm the realest you know

i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and i was like hold up
where you from? "how-bang"
where you stay? "westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
shots rang out, hoping to god i wasn't wet
crossed to cross rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
what happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
you my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you

but one thing you should consider, i'm the realest you know

i don't do black music, i don't do white music
i do everyday life music
you say you through, but i've been through it, now that's cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps, no power-steering
i use perseverance in this mad city
bernie mac died, it's no joke
don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but i'm high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
'cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
in other words, we get it cracking, but i keep it cool, y'know?

but one thing you should consider, i'm the realest you know

so there you have it
but i'm a leave you with this
an og once told me
a real gangster is either dead or in jail
or behind the scenes getting real money
i'm gone


h.o.c., h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
h.o.c., h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
h.o.c.

especially when drop drop the beat
i drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
jump in the booth, then shatter every rapper's dream
they jump in a sauna because i killed their self-esteem
that's a jab, you should bob and weave
like pam when martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
i go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
you telling me the kush make you think on level four?
i'm on five, you saying i can level more?
in high school, my teachers thought i was smoking stress
didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
i stimulate my mind every time i think about the end of time
creation of man and columbine

probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your endo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke

look, nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just 'cause they heard that new tape from wiz khalifa
knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
they new booties, they probably need baby powder
my skill shower over your city for forty days
before you get it twisted like forty gays
my flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
those the type of lines that i'm talking bout
you know, the type of rhymes you don't talk about
copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
brag on me like my son's bout to win
somehow, someday, and i don't care when
i might hit the gin once a month
i'll let you inhale/in hell, like an atheist

uh, i'll take you back to the ninth grade
when dough boy had me high for four days
but anyway, i think it was some purple
told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
i didn't listen, i was floating like the rose parade
that was the vegas trip hooters sponsored
just underline every letter
capital k-d-o-t, letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks, and what you bout?
nothing huh? am i square 'cause i don't puff a square?
are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? yeah

h.o.c., h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.


uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh
you boo-boo, you t
you turned down, you thirsty
you boo-boo

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna find myself, i'm searching deep for kendrick lamar
i read about napoleon hill and try to know god
they say he the key to my blessings
and if i speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
money flow like water, i'll just wait at the dock
and by the way i'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
i'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
but i notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with
who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
who dooney and bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves

cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say, oh my god
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it t-a-k-e just to reach the t-o-p
i'm talking ideas, motivation
oh, that's not your memo? then tell me why you constant stressing
i function with you and you flaunt your pistol
every second tell me how you pressed him at the monte crystal
where so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid

cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say, oh my god
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
i'm tryna feel the vibe of mona lisa, studying art
now paint that picture, life behind bars
remember the very day i got caught?
i murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
see what i was taught, family is all i need
but indeed, them too can run me right up a tree
wanting me to take sides, but i'd never give in
ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
for fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms
yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
come to my house just to yap about your own people, dang
and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
i would probably cut y'all off, too, yep

cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say, oh my god
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say

you turned down, you thirsty
you turned down, you thirsty
you thirsty, you boo-boo
you t, you turned down
you boo-boo, you t
you boo-boo, you turned down
you thirsty, you t
you boo-boo, you turned down
you boo-boo, you t
you turned down, you weak
keep all that

what is hiiipower?
hiiipower is the way we think, the way we live
see it's known today that the human race is nothing
no moral, no standards
what we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
no you don't have to have a lot of money
you don't have to be rich
but you will be rich in mind and spirit
some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang
hiiipower, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion



bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism
burning buildings, aids victims, cancer killing, no cure
oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken
police brutality kicking ass of us africans, hostages in afghanistan
not to mention another prison, child molesting
cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing
secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
that turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method
to hold us back, great depression, amongst iraq no direction
no google map, just a tec for the soowoo
swerving isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo
mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving
these commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science
no place to live in, no zion, see that's forbidden, we frying

that's exactly what hell look like, uh

tell it like it is, homeboy
tell it like it is, tell 'em what's up


malcolm laughing, martin laughing, biggie spitting
'pac is rapping, gregory capping, people singing, bells is ringing
children playing, angels praying, fourteen carat golden streets
cali greens, red wine, potato yams, turkey legs

watching martin on tv as it was t-d-s
for us to eat tv dinners every time we was famished
but it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
every time i put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants

i upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause
she need me, i got that john bryan love
had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
we was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
you know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
smoking beedies, laying on the futon
memories i got saved up like a coupon
and we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
i was broke then, couldn't count the best weed
then she would just leave in a black hatchback
homies from the hood used to ask me if i'd tapped that
i would say yep, smiling so freely
that was back then, but i bet she still need me
she need me, she need me

a crash dummy for diamonds, i know you dyin' to meet 'em
i'll prob'ly die in a minute


section 80

jump off
i never did nothin' but break the ground on top of the asphalt
tire mark gave you evidence that i'm easily peddlin' with the speed of a lightnin' bolt
as a kid i killed two adults, i'm too advanced
i live my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
truth be told, i'm like eighty-seven
wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire wit' devils holdin' hands
from the distance, don't know which one is a christian, damn
who can i trust in 2012? there's no one
not even myself, a gemini screamin' for help, somebody





the king of diamonds wit' diamonds i never do ask for
they checkin' my passport, i'm too accustomed with customs
she call in the task force, i killed it, somebody cuff 'im
they want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
when you pushin' a rav4, you wreckin' my jaguar
you play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard





i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimentin' me on my nappy hair
they'll prob'ly think i'm osama
the plane emergency landed, it was an honor

hol' up


got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

then i set him in cold water, then i order someone to bring him vicodin
hope to take the pain away from the feelin' that he feel today
you know, when you part of section.80, you feel like no one can relate
cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
i'm in the house party trippin' off my generation, sippin' cough syrup
like it's water, never no pancakes in the kitchen, man
no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
lookin' around and all i see is a big crowd that's product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream, yep
her president is black, she black too
purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
she take it straight to the head
then she look at me, she got a.d.h.d

got a high tolerance when your age don't exist


and then she started
and then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
beg your pardon, oh i rap baby, how old are you?
she say, "twenty-two," i say, "twenty-three," "okay, then we all crack babies"
damn, why you say that? she said, "where my drink at?
i'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors have the police relax"
i stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen, jumbotron
made to the back where she reside, then she said, read between the lines
yep, hope that i get close enough, when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up, when the nuvo start to drown
her body and i know the both of us really deep in the move now
it's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound
of that bay area kush, she looked at me then looked
at it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "get it understood
you know why we crack babies because we born in the eighties, that a.d.h.d crazy"

got a high tolerance when your age don't exist


you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light

concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
i stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
her complexion in a direction i've outgrown
damn girl, why so much?

and so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that
it was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
they got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
'cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
to lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim
so when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
the minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they

i'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
there's a more important topic i'd like to discuss
the dysfunctional bastards of the ronald reagan era
young men that learned to do everything spiteful
this is your generation

who's willing to explain this story?

i used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalized
my intuition has said i was suited for family ties
my momma is stressing, my daddy tired
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried to save me
how i'm gonna listen when i don't even hear god?
heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
i deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
stand for something, or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures
i want you to know that i'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music i wrote, hope it get you off death row
you came home to a pocket full of stones
a metro pc phone, then you went back in
so when i touch the pen, the pen is in my view
i'mma get it right, just so you

if it feel good to you, holla if you hear me

i'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
i'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful
the city got my back, and for that, i give them my torso
you think about it, and don't call me lyrical
i know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worrisome individuals that live life critical
so won't you bear witness while i bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me?

but anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break, eating in the parking lot
on "wanna be heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me, getting what i deserved
somebody said my name on the radio
he ain't know i was ready for, the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
he'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals, leaving her body sore
she take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr. shakur, that's her favorite rapper
bumping "brenda's got a baby" while a pervert yelling at her
and she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
the seven cars start honking, she start running like flo-jo
don't care if they joe blow, if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
she give all to her daddy but she don't know her father, that's ironic
see a block away from lueders park, i seen the el camino parked
in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
her anatomy is god's temple
and it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
she's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
she took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
it was a block away from lueders park, i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction
at first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners' redemption
that sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
block away from lueders park, i seen the el camino park
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat

my little sister eleven, i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song, set her down and pressed play

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars, oh
fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

i light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper


and this is rigamortus and it's gorgeous when you die
ali recorded, and i'm morpheus, the matrix of my mind
i'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
i climax where you begin and then i end on cloud nine
and that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
and don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
and i'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up, if you could fight, we always making 'em duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
ferragami so many and cool enough for the seventies
dead 'em all and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
wrestling, that's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better d
better be on your p and q, it's just me jay rock, soul and q
solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do


got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper


got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

i rapped him and made him casper, i captured the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya, i pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy, i assassin my casualty
and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
a lump sum of hundreds don't talk to me 'bout no money
the sun is under my feet and i come in peace to compete
i don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek and i get busy on many mc, really ballistic
anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see some persistence
recognize i be really too vicious the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your t
and i gon' mention how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
and i'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity

ride to it, ride to it 'cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did 'cause he ain't what you is
but we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

to the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
maybe this earth is ain't a good place to be
how far is heaven? let's see
is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
i wonder when i die will he give me receipts?
i wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me?
look at me, look at me, i'm a loser, i'm a winner
i'm good, i'm bad, i'm a christian, i'm a sinner
i'm humble, i'm loud, i'm righteous, i'm a killer
what i'm doing, i'm saying that i'm human, now people just

ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
but we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

it go one, two, three, two in the front, one in the back seat, seat, seat
seat, looking for a victim of an ak-47, hundred round each, each, each
but why must we retaliate? is it human nature?
i don't know, i look for the answers later
make a right, there they go

sometimes gotta ride to it, ride to it 'cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did 'cause he ain't what you is
but we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

as i open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
my plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
i'm dying inside, i wonder if zion inside the heavens
a condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a mac-11
that's all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
when i lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
i wonder if i'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
i give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
i'm running, they say i'm wilding a young'n with lack of guidance
that's hundreds of us with problems, more money, more drugs and violence
look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
that's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life, but regardless i'mma

ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
but we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
on the day niko had that seizure, i lost one of my biggest believers
close deaths make you think about your life
like if i had that same chance twice, what would i do different?
i'd tell her i loved her more, do more
but tease her 'bout crying on that picture
now when i'm done recording, swear i let the beat bang in her name
make her shake her head in heaven saying, they at it again
make them clouds turn to speakers, don't take too much smoke
from the reefer, love being in the room with her peoples
now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
lord, what kind of life is this?

mama said, "according to get everything
you gotta risk everything"

reality of dreams, younger for memories of a still wonder
of who i might be

so i can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
while these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
to write stories, a young poetic genius
and i mean this, there's never been a day off

get a break off just to rehire myself

yeah man, i'm sending this out to any of my girls that's different man
anybody that's special
you know i wanna be honest with you women so ima start off like this

uh look, i'm bold from the get go
go by the title of drake
and treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
i'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
when i say i've been disappointed i'm addressin a few
i finesse then i groove
while most of the 8 to 9's in my past
now get a rating that's less than a 2
its true, i been talking to aleshia, keisha and nadia
and shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
payback, to the same chicks from way back
never call, now they wanna be where i stays at
now they got the new boy, i'm trying to move forward
and pass me, classy, something like drew lord
a new me, cool, see i never get around
if i don't change now i don't think i'll ever settle down
even if i gotta travel a bit
i'll go around the world and back
'cause i know that once i have it that's it and uh,

you can't just love me like they do
i need someone special in you
i know that out there there's a few
see i've been searching i don't what to do
can you help me?
she gotta be special
by that i mean that you gon hold me down
you gotta be special
'cause you never know how people stick around
gotta be special

a girl i can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
yeah my name ain't change but i'm far from the man that i used to be
since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
and groupies are gettin' brave
rappers, i write 'em a verse
and ask me to spit it
but i pay no mind though
'cause they know i know
they wont sign so
drake and vo back
i take it you know that
you take it sitting down
or you can take it to gold black
and since drake done took it from curls to waves
it's been kind of like a whirlwind phase
i mean i had my share of women
with most of 'em its seemin like they world is staged
but from georgia to bk and all around the world
get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
if you've been hurt and you alone be steady
these the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh

you can just love me like they do
i need someone special in you
i know that out there, there's a few
see i've been searching, i don't know what to do
can you help me?
special
by that i mean that you gon hold me down
gotta be special
'cause you never know how people stick around
special

a girl i can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
yeah my name ain't change but i'm far from the man that i used to be
look there's requirements to be an admirer
still the new version of fresh needa a nia or tyra
so we can be jenny and swayze
i told you i'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
or maybe its karma
they say is a charmer
i'm fire on the move
a tire looking smooth
i'm not perfect but i got a desire to improve
i'm special
like kids in a graduating class
having more trouble than others when addin basic math
need you to be special like areba to cootmore
double o, top secret agents with suits on

lady, you say i stay in the house till four
we don't even go out no more
it's always the same eh
always complainin
it's obvious baby
i guess you don't watch the news
you see there's a lot to lose
'cause we got a baby
and people are shady

my generation is changin
aside from the fact
the dealers have customers they provide with the crack
front of the buses taken
and we denied from the back
you can die where from, or die where you at

don't put it past them
i don't think that they understood
my friends they don't even sit in the class when they should
he can come pick you up
if your dads in the hood
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

lady, somebody shot up the place right by
where i work and i think they might
be coming for me next
lend me ya kleenex
i'm tellin' you baby
i think i'm a bout to cry
'cause i gotta feed you
i hope that i see you again... again
hope that i see you, see you

don't put it past them
i don't think that they understood
my friends they don't even sit in the class when they should
he can come pick you up
if your dads in the hood
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

lately i don't know about the friends that i hang with
i'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
with dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
depends on what they do to achieve that
robbing r&amp;b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
get the info, leave with ya money man, that's how the world is

streets are seedy i call 'em sesame... berkstown
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
next week same place'll get burnt down
coincidink? not likely not a chance
how can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
at least start put a bid in, it's hard just to fit in
a lot of people only play they part when they spittin'
but i don't think that they understood
they using this darkness for penetration in the hood
i took the ivory way in and yes i'm glad that keenan could
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good


loves lost
loves gone
love lost

look,
in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
rappers they tend to be smilin'
because they swimmin in women
most of 'em sick of favors
they come in secret flavors
that's why i envy omar
because so far

and that's some higher learning
trying ta excel with the brake on
i'll have you stuck in the same spot
with the tires burnin
and i'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
in any female that's askin what i was earnin
i met this recent lady
she knew a piece of sadey by spinners
i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
'cause she ain't give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me
it's like i'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
now i'm out of both and i've been thinkin' of aleshia lately
i'm all alone, i got a feelin' its on
'cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
circling workplaces
and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
they get to first bases
then they get to retreating 'cause if she cheatin'
he wanna know what the first trace is
now you like macgyver
'cause you sneakin around
and she don't know that you there when you standin right beside her
i can't relate to that
i had to take it back a couple a years
when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact

i bet that they knew it 'cause in my mind i play through it
and in the end i listen but i don't see me as they do
'cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
and i used to be eager to buy 'em the world
maybe i'm confused about what i desire from girls
either way i'm all alone, got a feelin' its on
'cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

check,
and nowadays some girls are the type of person that
will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin
since i ain't made them a purchase yet
but there's logic behind it
emotions double and they try to cover up
like a mansion with the projects behind it
i tend to freak with this
i get a girl and pretend that i love the spendin
and all she gave was a decent kiss
thinkin' she been spoiled
but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days
and come up with tin foil

we could dissect it see
you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets
and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
gave her nothing
her reputations in jeopardy
'cause it ain't take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me
collectively i look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me
for thinkin' that exists, i got a feeling i'm wrong
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone


look,
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin'
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes at the bar with a freak and
steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech 'cause

i'm from the city where people be gettin' lazy
litterin in the streets
and the club district is poppin' like literally every week
and promoters'll push flyers
money exchange hands
liars sell you they dreams
and dummies exchange plans
hustlers give you events
bouncers give you pass
directors give 'em a shot
so girls'll give up the ass

and groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
daffy and bugs, it's all laughing and hugs
till the dude catch a plane
and she back where she was
right back on the bus
its ashame 'cause now at his rental
she throwin' bricks like shaq in the clutch
you can see that's she's colder
'cause he doesn't hold her
fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
know that he tried ta told her
that he couldn't mold her
if this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, i say

if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin'
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes at the bar with a freak and
steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech 'cause

now up north there's five artists deservin a listen
and i'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
but if you gotta think through
chances are that it ain't you
i singlehandedly carry out what you can't do
and see i take a couple of breathers
and then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
if you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
go ahead, i couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
but uh, the in and the out
whenever i'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
and every verse the man seem to kill
you can find him with black jays and socks like i'm andreena mill
japan and brazil, the audience acreaming
and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
advances to deals, financing appeals
the hustles, i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin'
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes in the bar with a freak and
steady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech 'cause


uh, yeah, get in my slick rick mode
n'a mean?, i'm a tell ya a story real quick

look,
she got a saying there's no alice without the tin man
crib was 2 mil, plus i just bought a couch for ten grand
even if the house was ten grand
and there was no pool
would i still be witout my swim fan?
the ceiling could be higher
she making requests
don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin' what i buy her
and purses are light now
she use 'em all the time
so she smilin' to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
and she simply a new model
stay spendin dollars
but she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
at times she a solid chick
and i'm a sucka for the cuties
so she always lookin' good when my wallets thick
chillin' on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
got a hunch that's she's feelin' other women
want the diamonds on the face in the center
nice guys finish last so i'm winnin' every race that i enter and she a

video girl
eh yo you have to listen
i'm in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldn't call her name
i got the feelin' that they all the same

and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
'cause i can't stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin' you shoulda stayed yourself

you're all the same
look at vida guerrera
there's no need to compare her
i bet she smiles 'cause she loves what she sees in the mirror
i bet she's out meetin directors instead
and frustratrated 'cause she's already been addressed in they head
be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
apply for a business loan and i'll bet you that they'll sign
if you a real dime
poppin' as if it's your only option
girl there's things to do
other than jail time
look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
i just give my opinion for laughter
or maybe to think on
so next time you out at the club
and a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
you just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on
now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
and as ya man i won't back down first
but they got you doing soft-core background work
that messed up like an officer that pulls you over
and he ask questions later and pat down first
but you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
the resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
look, i got a message, i'll say it
i got some beats still
regina hall and garcelle and alice neal
young girls these here women with big dreams
role models that you can watch on the big screen
if you refuse to change and you that chick still
respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
you got an audience believe it or not
my cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill

video girl
eh yo you have to listen
i'm in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldn't call her name
i got the feelin' that they all the same
and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
'cause i can't stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin' you shoulda stayed yourself

and i ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
you know as a person man. i love to see my black women strong, single,
independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
video you n'a mean? it's a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
this one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? 'cause it's like uh,
if she beautiful and honey dances
and you always downtown making money transfers
and anything the color of braces she get excited
she always showing up at these places she get invited
she a video girl


yeah, this dedicated to canada man
the whole up north
a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter
but listen...

i met this new girl late june or early july
i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
now it's december, i'm driving, and she's like where's my hi?
i swear, that i never called you 'cause i really get shy
see that was a segue, i believe the matter
is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter
where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up
where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in
the winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
and some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
and if you planning family vacations you better know when
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
where cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
but just wait, nah mean, take it slow

forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet
since i'm driving, i ask her how to get the suite
she doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
she throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
she's bold but i roll with it, i'm impressed 'cause she's sweet
then she says "i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat,
i mean, the lyrics are good, but i'm obsessed with the beat
i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good,
there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat"
off this i'm kinda takin' it back for a second,
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
until we end up sexin and now my heart attached
i'm thinkin' off i should've been more southern
and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

yeah, uh, i told y'all i had a story for you right
uh, ya man, it's what it is

and now, i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench
she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench
but, my boy say i'm actin' different, because i lay downtown
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
she tellin' everyone imma hold here down
tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town
and stupid me i just listen to her,
instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
when we were together it seeming like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
and it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
i guess, i lost another one to the wintertime

strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing

i remember them encore pms, breakfast and the wake up
now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
the winter came and blew his cold air through
back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her,
by the end of the week i would know that crew
and we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
we had ladie's hearts always gettin' damaged and stolen
but this summer is different it's a two man operation
granted the fact that we one man short
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
cause handin' them crack is a one man sport
instead of dress-up, i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin'
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
the face, the breast, the bras, the toes
'cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
we'll never talk again, scary and true
that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified
it's what i'm lookin' for to carry me through
yet i can't seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it
and when they talk about they past and lovers
and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others
yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive

strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing


southern smoke!

yeah. ho!
it's drake. uh uh. ho!
do that dance. do that dance

you special girl, don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so, at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

look i ought to be thankful because for women i have plenty of love
and when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex
or maybe before, i'm here waiting to score
it's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
instead these girls taking it raw,
now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more
wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
so they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
to the point that drake compare me to anthony mackie
but once they have my pants and my khakis
i tell them i'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
because, i hate waking up undressed with a dame

because you special girl, don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so, at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

i don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
it's something that i can rarely predict
all i know is that i can never find the love that tyler perry depict
i'm guessing maybe shemar moore isn't really all pure
maybe i lie to myself and it's like a small cure
i tell it all to her
i gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
because really, what is a window without a car door?
why i can't settle for one instead of all four?

...


when i'm the only one that's really spittin'

uh, i'm bringing back hip hop
va, toronto, hip-hop

aiight let me take my jacket off
unlace the timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
this time i'm blabbin on
these rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
mad 'cause the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
i got the gift like santa claus
flow got spring like a catapult
matter fact the flow supreme like diana ross
i'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
i know who you are 'cause he wanted me to eat ya
i said nah lets keep it peaceful
he gave it to us for a cheap cost, for prices we all could eat off
a real street dog
we have an impostor, alert the doctor
bout to hit him up with the chopper like blaka
shock 'em like blanca from street fighter, heat got a
hurricane kick, murder everything quick
look, my new ryu nine is stupendous
why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
my crew lie you guys into ditches
i said it and meant it the scorpio's mind has many dimensions
i'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin'
hope your listenin to my diction
if you are then you now should be itchin
that its crack we placed in your stereo system
yeah, i be at your burial trippin'
nickelus f from richmond
va,
the scorpio's mind is not a game to play wit all day

i've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
disliked by some, but confronted by none
since they don't show me sincerity, i load up, lock up
take shots at 'em i guess you could call it a parody
but compared to d
they one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
if that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be
you got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
and when the psychic get to touchin my palm
seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
especially when one of your artist feelin' threatened
'cause i'm harnessin a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
to play around, to perfection i'm the spittin' image
my verbal camp is vivid, i told you i'm spittin' image
it seems we often want to start but never get to finish
my verbal campus is villanova, and those of you feelin' hova
and writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
let me assist you like a specialist
so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
it's not a problem wit x, i guess i'm a pessimist
and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate
instead of understanding it's a tune of hate
the city's mine like oklahoma's a sooner state
and we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
so, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
you ain't morris chestnut, you lighter and less cut
and lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
you still a protege, that's the reason i don't holler
you got rappers being repetitive actors
you stay ahead of the game, i'm ahead of the practice boi


southern smoke!

yeah. ren. m.o.f. haha.
it's drake man. it's drake man.yeah
i'ma half to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean
ho! southern smoke!

very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing
the samples that they using, can't get through the clearing
i'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
my father's early careering forced my parents to split up
my mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
with just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus
and he got back into doing what he was doing before us
because money is an issue, your son he gon miss you
and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
now you looking for exes, you ain't never expect this
you end up doing time, and me i end up with a step-sis
nobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went
you know i hold you down because without you, i'd be a wasn't
and mommy i'ma support her, i keep it all in order
see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
but

i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
i'm just trying to live my life 'cause
make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife 'cause bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!
i'm just trying to live my life 'cause
make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife 'cause bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!

this is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what i been through
i write a verse addressing it, and yes i might offend you
picture when i was in school,
me being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what i was into
rest of the kids were sheltered, i never liked to fight
now i'm grown i can say what it is
it's parents that got these black and filipino nannies raising they kids
and your daddy want it very right
i make you happy, plus i'm jewish, he don't approve, i think he want you to marry white
he want sinatra at the wedding, not barry white
because black is black honey, even if he's very light
and so i never been for dinner at they places
always brutally honest, and so i pin it to they faces
i live it so the case is, whether drake is
way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
i'm just trying to live my life 'cause
make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife 'cause bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!
i'm just trying to live my life 'cause
make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife 'cause bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!

am i hot as the rest, should i strive for my spot as the best
like girls with double d's, i gotta lot on my chest
there's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
and yes, when i'm dismissed after a tedious listen
i sit at home and say i should have been a pediatrician
homie, i probably could have been on tv consistent
an artist like pablo, or maybe petey's assistant
and my mindset is come and get me
i'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me
so, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson
if not, you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond
last couple of months i done probably been
around the world and back, and i don't wanna question half the places nick been

i'm just trying to live my life 'cause
make a little money, find a bunny
make a little money, find a bunny


yeah
check

sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough
to feel what i'm about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just wanna be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
it is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snappin
and they try to make you out as a lie
symbolic 'cause you were just trying to please em' by using logic and reason
it's a lose/lose why even try
when your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
to try and make 'em a mill
you never noticed the fact you might be working what i'm receivin' at first
i mean there's always some blame to put on yourselves 'stead of claimin' you couldn't help
and maybe next time you ain't in town

you gonna try to try harder 'cause
try harder 'cause
try, try-try-try

and the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spittin' the pressure
than most of the rappers running the game
concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit to cash
there's time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience
that made you tell anybody i meet that i ran
sometimes i wish that i woulda just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers
'cause i'm really telling me what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
i wasted late out at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i working hard on the winner
so this album is a labour of love
you say as long as i'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
then she can rest without a toss or a turn
'cause she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv
that's exactly why i often get burned
but i'm gonna try to...

try harder 'cause
try, try-try-try


uh, what up y'all!
soundtrack what's popping baby?
y'all ain't know, i go by the name of lupe fiasco
representing that first and fifteen
jyea, uh!
and this one right here
i dedicate this one right here
to all my homies out there grinding
you know what i'm saying?
legally and illegally
hahaha...
you know what i'm talking about?
so, check it out

first got it when he was six
didn't know any tricks
matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
landed on his hip
and bust his lip
for a week he had to talk with a lisp
like thisssss
now we can end the story right here
but shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
yeah, he said it was something so appealing
he couldn't fight the feeling
something about it
he knew he couldn't doubt it
couldn't understand it
brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
kakunk kakunk kakunk!
his neighbors couldn't stand it so
he was banished to the park
started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark
yeah, when they said, "it's getting late in here...
...so i'm sorry young man there's no skating here"

and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so let's kick... and push... and coast

my style is very tennessee
mixed with some terry kennedy
people barley remember me from back in the day
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
luckly my aunt working as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
if i 'm staying in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she say you need to be doing something other than skating
why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
so now it's me and old school
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
he knew i didn't really wanna post here
open up the window told me that the coast clear
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
homie this is recess east test
life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes i'm literly landel lewis with a kick and a snare
kick flip in the air
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
just so the space ain't restricted in here
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
i say aunty this is a safe career
she said drake i told you there's no skating here

and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so let's kick... and push... and coast

before he knew he had a crew
that wasn't no punk
and they spitfire shirts
and sb dunks
they would push till they couldn't skate no more
office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
and it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing they said
any escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy
they needed to break out
they head to any place with stairs
any good grinds
the world was theirs
uh, and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said, "there's no skating here"

and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so let's kick... and push... and coast


after this, i don't have a choice. i got people to provide for, promises i've made, and goals to meet. hmm... what chu got?

comeback.


shake up the world.
that is what i'm about to do,
and homie you ain't even on my altitude.
i'm tellin' you, i got enough cloud for two,
they like, "damn who's drake, where's wheel-chair-jimmy at?"
i'm cuttin' lights out like it's bedtime.
these other rappers lukewarm like red wine.
the truth hurts so please don't rub it in.
i'm not signed yet, so i'm still budgetin'.
i'm like jeopardy,
i'm still buzzin' in every city that you gotta nephew or a cousin in.
i can't even afford a mistake these days.
all of my favorite girls miss drake these days.
please don't take offense to my ways.

'cause i need drug money,
who got drug money?
i am talkin' "white phantom sittin' on dub" money.
i am talkin' "cold champagne at the club" money.
and no i ain't emotional but baby i love money.
to all these a&amp;r's that's playin' stars
your girl know how i beat it like a flat drum.
i spit dirty like i'm chewin' on black gum.


oh!
yes!

i'm sure it can be resolved i'm just hopin' that they make up.
i've perfected my craft using mo zest,
tryna make some cheese off a single is a process.
get it?
craft. single. cheese. process.
sit back and admire the talent that i possess.
top notch, no less.
oh yes.
i'm known in the city, but need to bust out like a model to show chest.
cause you deal with agents from check collections.
i'm keepin' it clean in a little x direction.
and baby girl if you don't like me, it's probably due to the fact that you are last like next selection.
the city is mine, i control this.
you know this.
i'm a jamaican doctor, the bay, what up otis?
i'm back with the form like opus i go.
yeah,
and i'm a teach it so you learn right.

and after that i take em' back like returned flights.

yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah

after the struggle and the pain
and to remain in the game
after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies
i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin'

i was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
running from polices, jumping over fences
serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
the teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
make your outlook on life different, damn you look suspicious
my granddad died a boss, and that's been on my memory
if you listen closer to me, feel the pain in my delivery
the struggle and the pain, i still remain the same
i'm grinding so hard i'm just strengthening up my brain
flyer then the plain, moving faster then the train

after the struggle and the pain
and to remain in the game
after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies
i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin'

damn it feel like yesterday i'm at the corner store
when the po-po ran up on me in mexico
i dropped the blow i swear i never ran that fast before
and when i play it back in my memory in the studio
i swear i grind and i grind going hard every time
going hard on my grind
i write a hundred songs every time i think of this
take a 2 liter fill it up with codeine
and i'm a ride i'm a ride
until the rubber off the tires, only the strong survive

after the struggle and the pain
and to remain in the game
after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies
i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin'

my glasses made from germany, designer on me permanently
these scars on me permanently, this pain insides burning me
but it ain't killing me, it's boosting up my energy
i'm on my way to tennessee, doing a show for 10 a key
and these streets they're a beast out here
i don't plan on coming home i might leave you this year
so many lies, so many broken promises
but you don't take it no more, you sick and tired of it

after the struggle and the pain
and to remain in the game
after you grind and survive
and you grind and you grind
i know cheated a million times
and you caught me in so many lies
i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin', i ain't lyin'

meant to crush your world, and i never
thought i would see the day we grew apart, and i wanna know

how do you let it go? when you
you just don't know? what's on

pretending that we get along

it's been a year and everything i said would happened has
while everybody that i know is out havin' a blast
i was right here in the studio bustin' my ass
and now i got this
i taste the blood, no one can stop this
second i drop this, die hard fans is finna cop this
while the rest of the world follows through fiber optics
i took my time, see i studied the game, learned how to rhyme
i was around drugs and gats, but never delved in crime
had other things in mind, so i began to grind
first tape was a success
locally, i got press
but i knew this one right here would run the world a mess, but i digress
a year ago, i was a youngin in his room
staring out the window, lookin' at the moon, knowing it's coming soon
but today i board this rocket ship and sonic boom
'cause i am no longer a seed, homie, it's time to bloom


we should shine a light on, a light on
and the book i write on, write on, it was right on
we should shine a light on, a light on
and the book i write on, write on, it was right on
we should shine a light on, a light on
and the book i write on, write on, it was right on
we should shine a light on, a light on
and the book i write on, write on, it was right on

they lost it i found it, we leave 'em astounded
asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
i replied, i died inside, resurrected a beast
leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
got it, capisce?, hungry as hell trying to eat now
success is the only thing that can complete us
grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this
now i've accepted i'm not from the hood
cause selling crack and busting gats don't make my raps good
see this is me, l.o.g.i.c. repping md to the fullest
push us to the limit but never pull us now
i can't wait 'til i see my name in neon
every day i take chances, celine dion
i'm a diamond in a rough, but i shine like discos
surrounded by greasy people like i doused them in crisco
i haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
up a million percent until they finally hear this though
bumping up in they city like, oh my god this go
my business getting better every year like fiscal
i'm original see but they trace like stencil
i stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
it takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
i did it in 21, see i'm ahead of my time
'cause when i flow the crowd never roll 'cause i rock
on the road to success, haters in my blind spot

we should shine a light on, a light on
and the book i write on, write on, it was right on



see all i ever wanted was a window to sit close to
and you don't understand but in the end you ain't supposed to
i'm talking first class, 30,000 feet under my ass
living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash
now i'm living a life that you and yours could only dream about
rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror
until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer
see this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days
fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days
good god, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance
96' kool-aid and sega genesis

"hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
i love the way your lyrics make me feel\"
roll it and get high, light it up and fly
feeling like i'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

i got em' saying

"hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
i love the way your lyrics make me feel\"
roll it and get high, light it up and fly
feeling like i'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

so many people think that they know my whole situation
conversations with people that handle public relations
nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations
slowly pacing until i kill like that boy jason
it ain't nothing, never folding or bluffin'
kiss em', touch em' and rub em'
hit it fast but then i slow it down like robitussin
shorty giving me brain until concussion
the club run out of vodka the second we rush in
never under estimate the power in which i'm bustin'
my lyricism got yo girl blushin'
award shows, chilling with all my bros
three-piece ralph lauren and some jordans, i suppose


ayo, shout out to black diamond. i got them nikes on my feet as we speak, homie. shout out to mac... miller

all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money
all i do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money

all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
i'm one of a kind

my name is logic, if you don't know by now, i'm always on my grind
and at this moment in time, i'm on a road when i write this rhyme
sitting behind raheem devaughn while he's passed out
'bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
look outside the window, i see shorties with they asses out, oh my
good god, you know we fly
day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
see i ain't signed but at this point in time
i'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
all i do is rhyme and get money, that's my repertoire
holla at honeys, \"voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?\"
riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money
all i do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
i'm one of a kind
all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money
all i do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
i'm one of a kind

maybe at a house party while you getting lit
or while you cruising 'round town riding in a whip
one thing's for sure, you better get all of your friends here
got a booty, know how to use it, homie yes i rocks her
the second i jump on a stage, i'm rocking it, ain't nobody stopping it
whoever goes on after me, i'm sorry, you ain't topping it
it's going down, feeling like a millionaire
riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money
all i do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
i'm one of a kind
all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money
all i do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
i'm one of a kind

ever since i was a youngin i knew i'd break in the game
while you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained
i was strategizing before the people knew my name
fame what i shall attain on the road to success
bumping jay in the h.o.v. lane
searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
i know we fight, but that's poquito
unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money
all i do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
i'm one of a kind
all i do is rhyme, all i do is get this money
all i do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
all i do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
i'm one of a kind

marty randolph

logic
all right man, what is this regarding exactly?

marty randolph
basically, what we want to do is we want to take logic, we want to take everything about you, and we want to take it and put it on a bigger level. how's that sound?

logic
i mean that sounds great, man! what do you have in mind?

marty randolph
basically, okay, you know that whole thing that compiles you? the whole young sinatra, smooth, intellectual lyrics, the realism of who you are and how you project that, everything that you do with your music?

logic
yeah, man, thanks. i'm glad you spotted that out.

marty randolph

logic
...what?

marty randolph

logic
i don't know man... i really don't know...

marty randolph
have you ever heard of young lollipop? or little chedda?

logic
naw. naw, man i haven't.

marty randolph
exactly. that's the point!

logic
wait... where did you say you were calling from again?

marty randolph
oh, i'm just calling from, uh... sell out records.

logic
what?! sell out records?!...

marty randolph
yeah!

logic
oh my god. wait... like you, like, sell out stadiums and stuff?

marty randolph

logic
what?! illuminati?!

satan
yes, logic. it's your time now.

logic

satan
uh, no. no. uh, i don't know where else to look. look, just sign with us.

logic

satan
oh... hello? hello? damn it! he hung up. these rappers are usually the easiest ones to convert....


yeah, yeah, yeah i'm a get it right now and never will i give up
homie this is food for thought you better fill up
i'm coming in strong with a song for very long
so i gotta make you understand before the beat is gone
homie you are not alone, we are in the zone
living in a world of lies i can't take it
needed someone to save me, needed someone to hug me
needed a whole world but nobody would love me
'had i learned from this that people wanna buck me
had i learned from this that people wanna buck me'
i said i can't take it i know i'm gonna make it
i know i'm not normal but i gotta fake it
i swear i'm not cocky, i am just confident
that when i step on the stage i am dominant and now i am beggin

beggin, beggin you
put yo' loving hand out baby
beggin, beggin you
put yo' loving hand out darling

sick of living in the dark so i'm begging for the light
feeling like i'm in a fight every single time a write
'cause i gotta make sure that they hear me right
told me that i couldn't do it so when i pick up the mic
i gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it
they can feel what's in my soul
lyrical cocaine yeah homie i got a blow
but first they gotta know who i is
so i'm begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big
'cause i ain't new to this i'm true to this
thinking i'm a stand up and roll out homie that's ludacris
not here to play no games, i'm here to stay and make a change
and mate your ways so i remain
i'm in the studio for days and days
spittin' out these razorblades, don't wanna place no blame
but without you i couldn't get to where i'm headding
so to everybody i'm begging

beggin, beggin you
put yo' loving hand out baby
beggin, beggin you
put yo' loving hand out darling

yeah, yeah, i said this is my path don't mess with me
i didn't choose this life it was destiny
god tested me to find the best of me
and i know i'm going to make it even without a degree
and when you said that i would fail it didn't get to me
now i'm begging, public masses, please
i'm way to proud to get down on my knees
but i'm begging, on another level
'cause i am not about that i just wanna love
i just wanna grow, i just wanna learn
the pass and the verbs to write this music
i'm so late that i just might lose it
but don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it
i just wanna help it but not hurt it
and as for my style i don't know how to word it
why do you even have to categorize me?
'cause i'm gonna take this, fill it up and make this
something that the whole word cannot imagine
let alone fathom i'm from another planet
i swear i'm not mathic, listen to me dammit
my future's in your hands and so i'm beggin

beggin, beggin you
put yo' loving hand out baby
beggin, beggin you
put yo' loving hand out darling


logic
music. shows. relationships. fame. happiness. music. fortune. staying humble. music. fans. grinding. shows. music. touring. money. fate. music. god. fear. bills. friends. enemies. family. music

step into the mind of a young man
and if you don't then i don't really give a damn
all i wanna do is make you understand
but if you don't wanna listen i guess you ain't a part of the plan
sorry if i digress
all i ever wanted was to be the best
through lyricism to put your mind to the test
feelin' bulletproof, no vest, but i confess
my mind's a mess, living in a world of stress i digest
but i gotta keep grinding
'cause everyday success what i'm finding
and i don't give a damn if you hate on me
'cause when i blow what you gon' say homie?
heh, not a goddamn thing
but that's enough of that, i'ma let my home girl sing

camille michelle gray
knocked down, round for round
you're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
you might be knocked down, round for round
you're feeling like you're shot down on the ground

logic
all i think about is music
don't get me wrong i think
about other things but this how i fuse it
so the whole wide world can use it
when you feel like you just might lose it
take a breath, homie, don't confuse it
take a step in the mind of logic
as long as you don't abuse it
so let me break it down for the whole world
like i broke it down for my old girl
no more, gotta let it go, let it unfurl
'cause i remember the time
when i was living sublime, wanted to make a living off of my rhymes
but the whole world told me never mind
i'm a star, how could i not shine?

camille michelle gray
knocked down, round for round
you're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
you might be knocked down, round for round
you're feeling like you're shot down on the ground

logic
i just wanna take it to another level
that i've never even been on so i can sit on
every single piece of paper that i put a pen on
and when i been on for like ten years
i'ma do it better than anybody before me
so the whole wide world will adore me and no need to assure me
and if you wonder why i'm rapping so fast
it's 'cause i gotta lot of things on my mind
that wanna come out at the same time
in other words i'm racing
i used to pursue my dreams, but now they're reality
and that's what i'm chasing
why are we on this earth?
why must we feel pain?
why does everybody feel the need
to judge one another when we're all the same?

camille michelle gray
knocked down, round for round
you're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
you might be knocked down, round for round
you're feeling like you're shot down on the ground


i would like to make an announcement
to everybody that said i wouldn't amount to anything
in the minds of music
i told you, what did i tell you?
didn't i tell you
'cause i told you
mmhmm
and when did i tell you
a long time ago
and what did i say
what happen when i told you
exactly what just happened

i love to jump up on the track
so poetic with the champagne
i'm sipping got me spitting moetic
the second i aim i dead it
now give me the credit
'cause i envision myself living in wealth
breakfast at tiffany's
lunch at louis v's
now excuse me please
i got dinner plans overseas
killin' with ease
young sinatra got your girl
and now she a bobby soxer
girl with nice clothes
and thick curls



logic
on my charlie sheen, homie, yes i am a winner
and when it comes to making music, i am no beginner
hit the stage and get wild, my braniac's loud
call me 007 because i bond with the crowd
you shine like a star but i sun it
50 keep it a 100, homie you know i run it
the game needs change and logic can break a 100
i had a shorty to bun it, until she didn't want it
so i focused on the flow and they gon' put me on the map
with a pocket full of change, every day a different dime
when i rhyme they up on me 'cause they seen how i'mma shine
now you may be wondering how my raps rock
'cause i'm so fifth key to the right of caps lock
and when my tracks drop i'mma be sipping ciroc
with a whole skyline chilling in the backdrop

phil ade
and i swear i'm what these rappers can't bear, warn teddy
my pro tools bouncing like a '64 chevy
i'm trying to win fast y'all on that eddie
plus carl and harriet, g is how i carry it
been in it for miles, don't believe ask darius
running this beach like chariots of fire
i aspire to be higher than these superficial liars
the attire i acquire cost a grip, buy your pliers
i'm a ball out and die in maryland, len bias
apply a sire to my name, yeah you ain't know i'm royal
i foil from slick talk, yeah trip of that oil
toying with girls feelings, lord forgive me i need healing
i know you said it's wrong but a long would make a killing
hit the bong i hit the ceiling, hit the drink i hit the floor
if they show 'em in the buildin to the crowd then let me know



yo, this joint here, is for all my homies that i got. you know what i'm sayin', smoke to this joint, vibe out be cool. created a little soundtrack for when they high.

you used to hate it, now you love it
smile in my face, i think nothing of it
yeah i'll shake ya hand, kill 'em with kindness
so spark it up, and get lifted
please check the rappin', you know that i'm gifted
pretty perfume, i love to sniff it
she love the stick, and the way i shift it
automatic, in the rain
switchin' lanes, like i switched dames
maybe 'cause they, so god damn high
smoking on that green, got my mind faded

yeah you know we fly, never fallin'
well rounded, so you know we ballin'
women love us, fella's hate us
i ain't perfect, but i know that i'm one of the greatest
yeah you know we fly, never fallin'
well rounded, so you know we ballin'
women love us, fella's hate us
i ain't perfect, but i know that i'm one of the greatest

so i'm back again, like i never left
if you really wanna get it girl we can meet up, high price hotel most def
so i'm living large, supersize
if you want beef, i'mma leave you fries
complimentary suits, complimentary rides
it's all free, no charge like my phone died
i remember times, highschool
chasing dimes, like a fool
smoking bud, sticky icky
if the bag was light, told 'em call me ricky
'cause you got some explaining to do!
then we would kick it, with some pretty girls

yeah you know we fly, never fallin'

yeah you know we fly, never fallin'
well rounded, so you know we ballin'
women love us, fella's hate us
i ain't perfect, but i know that i'm one of the greatest


i wouldn't wanna have it any other way
i'm addicted and i just can't get enough...

knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
i'ma, i'mma come through and show my wood pine

logic
when people would joke around and say i signed with the devil
'cause it's gotta be a sin to be this good
yeah i been offered four of five deals
bust like banana clips boy that's four or five kills
doing the most accumulating so much bread
i think it's time for toast and i ain't talking fine wine
then when i blow like mine the whole world gon' see me shine
this is the life that i should live homie
i'm never going back, i'm addicted to the game
y'all can tell by the tracks

knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
i'ma, i'mma come through and show my wood pine

i wouldn't wanna have it any other way
i'm addicted and i just can't get enough

i wouldn't wanna have it any other way
i'm addicted and i just can't get enough

logic
i'm addicted to the game, addicted to the pain
of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
living a life that most won't attain
and i know it is essential
for now i just be chillin' with ballers
poppin' collars, pushing impalas, cutting records and counting dollars
i'm addicted, my lines is cocaine
and when they disperse blow minds like propane
and you know these haters that never made it this mad
'cause they never had what we had
addicted to the game and i'm glad

knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
knockin', knockin' doors down, showing 'cause around
i'ma, i'mma come through and show my wood pine

i wouldn't wanna have it any other way
i'm addicted and i just can't get enough...


logic taught me.
so, uh... it's been twenty-four hours. got my money?
oh... uh, you know what, just give me till next friday. i'll have it for you.
oh-oh, uh, that's funny. i could've sworn i said 'have it today'?
yeah... i don't have it, sorry.
oh. well all right then...
yeah, that's what happens man!

logic
i'm stewie griffin
and this game is brian
beatin' the hell out of em'
tryin', to get this money
check the statistics
the chances of me blowin' up are far from realistic
to have a chance at fame, i'd never miss it
i know i'm gonna be famous cause my friends and family insisted
but it's time to let off, set off, break this bread off
all i do is get this money
cut these records and cool out
but i kinda see it as louis vuitton day
'cause when i step up on the stage
i'm snatchin' mics like kanye
that's andre
three stacks, i do it big
take no relax, i'm spittin' the facts
catch me in the booth, droppin' tracks
yeah they talkin' 'bout me
yeah, i know they talkin' 'bout me
yeah i know they talkin' 'bout me but
never face to face, they evade it
by rappers i'm hated
because i'm fly, while they just levitated
as the hating escalated
my flow, it just elevated

logic
young jedi, all i do is stack bread
i said i be in the crib bumpin' red hot chili peppers
this right here for all my city reppers
fly talker, sky walker, get gritty reppers
follow your dreams, this life ain't what it seems
they used to tell me i'd never make it
now my flow streams
across the world, spit lyrics, let them unfurl
poetic rhetoric my girl
got my mind playin' tricks on me
my eyes is closed, the ice is froze, i got it
hip-hop was never dead, but it was fallin'
and i caught it
the way i process chips, you think my brain's robotic
i went from switchin' lanes in the rain
to switchin' planes with dames
poppin' champagne, spittin' game, and gettin' brain

stewie griffin
don't bring that trash in here. this is my house!


making so many moves i need a dose of dramamine
for rap i'm a fiend, come and test my team
my cerebral cortex force, my trigger finger reflex
to bust tecs like raw sex, ain't no tellin' what's next
i sling mixtapes like crack rocks
watch snow bunnies chillin' in the backdrop, discussin' how the track rocks
goddamn, i'm a miraculous man
and if i wasn't logic, i'd be his number one fan
beware i'm spittin' fire cause the world is in dire need of an mc to admire
and set the bar higher
so i conspire, within my mind just had a friar
the rap messiah, fresh to death so peep the attire
feelin' like b rabbit when he slaughtered the lotto
you say potato, i say potato
you call 'em rappers but all i see is comedians
mcs approach, take notes, and then i bury them
i'm out of this world, my studio's the planetarium
the second i utter lyricism that leave all the rest in the gutter
i thought i told y'all i'm the best, d-d-did i stutter?
i'll hit your mom in the head with a car bomb just to blow her mind like vietnam
had a myspace account but my only friend was tom
psych, it's a joke i swear that i'm not racist
to be honest i'll murder you no matter what color your face is
punch you in the face if i catch you slippin' in braces
you want beef? i'll choke you to death with your own shoelaces
psych, i swear i'm not a violent guy
once upon time i brought a super soaker to a drive-by
full of kool-aid and warm piss
my buzz is growing every day and when the swarm hits
million dollar trips, sex at the ritz
blow the competition to bits, leavin' the enemy lit
but i'm out cause there's women to please and money to get
it's logic


logic
various women i'm swimming in like a shark
hold up, that was the first one
let me run it back and restart
young sinatra ripping the beat apart
shining like a diamond
when i be rhyming
but y'all in the dark
on point like a poisonous dart
i can feel it now
the fame is coming soon
how can sky be the limit when there's footprints on the moon
now, i used to bus tables now i bust rhymes
spitting lines to the illest of dimes
just to pass the time
living like a don
mafietic mind state
hip-hop heads never die, we multiply then dominate
now i been flowing since a adolescent up until the present
rehearsing flows for various shows
yeah that's how i roll
getting respect and never neglect
that as i infect, they detect it, and when i dissect
rip it and wreck it now
that's on the record
as the vinyl spin so slowly
bringing verses like a holy
bible, my flow is tribal
meet me in the street homie i'm liable
to get it right then and there
he come from
got music for days and then some
they were stepping confident until i made 'em run
you know it's logic
in your vicinity murder evil entities
better known as your enemies
you feel it now
spark the l and you be coolin'
chillin' relaxin' to this audio satisfaction
i leave mc's missin' in action
leave you gashin
from a thousand lashes
why i'm laughing with a passion
standing over you smiling
till i hear sirens then i'm dashing

az and nas
that buck that bought the bottle
coulda struck the lotto
got rhymes 365 days and plus some

logic
this second verse is dedicated to rappers that never made it
'cause they gave up on their dream
in other words they hesitated to take it
but i swear i'mma make it better than ever before
cause half of y'all don't even know
see i be rolling through the streets
in a beamer bomber like hiroshima
gonna hit you like katrina until they like \"damn gina!\"
i eat mcs like fast food
hella rude
i'm the reason that your favorite rapper's in a bad mood
my name is logic
i was born in 1990
ain't no need to remind me
that when you listen you wanna rewind me
all the labels wanna sign me
for the right reason
we aim to please
hunting dollars and it's buck season
'cause

az
that's why we get high
cause you never know when you're gonna go
that's why we puff lye
cause you never know when you're gonna go
that's why we get high
cause you never know when you're gonna go



aight, yeah, yeah, homie i'm comin'
i'm coming and i'm never gonna give up
my mentality is making rappers feel like
they can never even live up to logic
you bust i dodge it
think you seein' me, nah, you just miragin'
i'm gunnin, i'm gunnin like a semi-automatic
that's really equipped with lyricism, i'll let 'em have it
i blast it, any style that you comin' at me with


yeah, you know i had to keep it going
kid rhymes that blow minds and see foreign
real recognize real and you lookin' foreign
i was spittin' flows before i was even born in the womb
and i'm a keep it up until the tomb
and as for the fame, yeah i know it's coming soon
'cause i'm goin' in raw, finna bust up in your room
i hit a beat and it's ergence to emerge in the game
pukin the dukin's i'm too sick to spit that yoga flame
the way i figure this is rap second renassaince
spittin' dirty sentences, so i'll they affecting medicine
ha, i'm havin' sentence spittin' fire like a demon
as the internet i let my flow to get to streamin', i'm beamin'
flawlessly listen in that women in yo head while you dreamin'
tryna' get you to buy that album, tryna get you feenin'
see my vision as i commentate it
you wanna see naked rerun of the bait but the hater ate it
success is truly overrated
i've seen caster with a blow up to pop and get deflated
see yeah, you made it but all your fans hate it
and it's kinda lookin' like you were sittin' negotiatin'
when it comes down to the rap game you see i'm integrated
half white half black i had it incorporated
get the money


yeah, i'm just a youngin' with a dream
with expenses till sixteen
quite the microphone fiend
now the rap is not mean
when i step up on the scene
all the girls see my scheme
till i open up my mouth and they find out my lyrics mean
had i meet up with raheem
drinkin' a whole team
but before i execute a perfect plan i gotta scheme
cause right now i'm on the dolo
everything about this tape i did it on the solo
yeah, i said it's hurricane logic
remember they can't dodge it
they gon' be bumpin' me from the birds to the projects
i get on the mic and excite anybody around me
you're probably wondering why the boy has not found me
it's not that easy, i gotta work from the ground
be the center of attention, look at the people around me
black on the inside, my outside ritz
what's a cracker without a cheese
i gotta stack chips

"you have interfered with our affairs for the last time"


oh, oh, ah
take it, take it, take it
take it slow
take it, take it, take it
take it slow

shawty i don't know you
but you know i'm trying to get to
know you think i'm fine but my mind that's what gets you
so let me lay you down, baby girl let me split you
yes you know i want it but first i'ma get to know you
'cause this ain't about your body, take my hand and let me show you
now what we have is partnership i won't try to control you
i just want to ride, i just want to fly

i just want to take it slow
baby you already know
i just want to take it slow

i just want to take it slow
baby you already know
i just want to take it slow

baby girl i think i really want to speed it up
lay you in the bed, kiss slow let me heat it up
but i promise i'll be gentle when i beat it up
never do it on the regular but i'mma eat it up
kiss you, touch you, tease you
doing anything and everything i need to please you
what it is, momma let me know right now
ain't no need to talk i just want to bite down
on your bottom lip, let your bra rip open
never had a feeling like this and i'm hoping
we could do it again, never thought i could find heaven within
a heart of a woman and now i begin
to understand more than i did from the start
gimme your heart, trust me with love
baby girl i swear you fell from above
lend me your hand, i'll be your man
i promise to do everything that i can
i'll be your sinatra, be my monroe
give me your heart and i'll know it will grow
i put it on everything baby my love is yours for the taking, my darling, my drug
and now i know, and now i know


lykke li
watch my back, so i make sure
you're right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you won't know
dry my eyes so i won't show
i know you're right behind me...


thought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather
i think about you and imagine a house and some kids
i wonder if you found another and it's all his
see baby girl, i know you love me even through the lies
cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes
sometimes i see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl i know you hear it
and even though the time is wrong i know the love is right
that's why there's so much emotion whenever i recite
anything about this angel that lost its sight
baby you were my everything, but you playing games
but you ain't worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action
i used to count the days with you but now i just subtract them

lykke li
watch my back, so i make sure
you're right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you won't know
dry my eyes so i won't show
i know you're right behind me...

you were my best friend but then you out me
i never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me
i write it so that the people can feel better
that have gone through what i've gone through
memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you
and if you think i write this song to taunt you
i don't want you, i want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday
and have an endless love with an angel from up above
but now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
and another path within my life is calling
even my music, and when you left me i didn't lose it
i channeled deep within emotions and used it
my heart you broke it and bruised it
so now i address this microphone and just ooze it

lykke li
watch my back, so i make sure
you're right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you won't know
dry my eyes so i won't show
i know you're right behind me...

watch my back, so i make sure
you're right behind me as before
dry my eyes so you won't know
dry my eyes so i won't show
i know you're right behind me...


logic
i am not a poet, i am just a designer of words
architect of sentences the way i form and merge
paragraphs together that force emcees to submerge
with an urge to break free of this biracial jail cell
feast on my memories, please come and taste this
papa was a black man, mama was a racist
while the whites got whiter, and the blacks got blacker
i was hurting, doing everything i can
perceived as a white boy with the soul of a black man
goddamn, looking up to malcolm x
studying his speeches, underlining text
how can i be white devil if my parents had sex
'cause i'm black and i'm white
and i'm proud of every word that i recite
i know my roots, i know my past
i know the issue of my race ain't gonna last
we all breathe the same air and bleed the same blood
and when we die, the same ditch gets dug



i'm on the come up
anything that y'all do i'm one up
y'all grind till like 3 in the morning
i grind till the sun up
homie that's dedication
this world is what i'm facing
i only hope in the end that they all love and embrace me

but it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song)
momma i'm sorry that i left at 17

logic
everything ain't what it seem when you try and follow your dreams
first you saw the bigger picture
now you see behind the scenes
you thought everything was sweet
got a taste now you a fiend
been into it since a teen
yeah he nice so all his friends say he gon' blow like hiroshim
himself on the cover of vibe magazine
but everything ain't what it seems
though it seem like he gon' blow
will he make it?
maybe so
too be honest i don't know
he got lyrics, he got flow
but it takes so much mo'
so much love
so much pain
with such little time to grow
yeah we love it when he smile
but hate it when he frown
remember when that girl turned his world upside down
but it made his music better
brought emotion made it clever
now we growing everyday
but he hungry try to eat
brain like an ekg the way that he study the beat
now we know that he gon' make it and he won't accept defeat
now i ain't tryin' to be mean
now i ain't tryin' to be mean
but everything ain't what it seem

logic
so many times did i design a rhyme to blow your mind?
'cause i know that i wasn't destined to live a life of crime
i remember christmas's with no presents
i use to fear my future now i dread my adolescence
living a life of logic
but it ain't what it's cut out to be
hip hop is politics
filled with nothing but strife and stress
time is money and it's hard to invest
step on the stage i get the honeys so wet
rockin' thousand dollar tuxes sippin on nothing but moet
this game is war and in my mind i'm like a vietnam vet
now i'm on the come up
anything that y'all do i'll one up
y'all grind till 3 in the morning; i grind till the sun up
homie that's dedication
this world is what i'm facing
i only hope in the end that they all love and embrace em

slowly elevated, escalated onto another level ha
my flow is crack the game is whitney yeah
fame is bobby on their first date it ain't hit me yet
visualizing driving down the horizon
while you despising the fact that i'm rising
steppin to me yeah you better be alphabetically ready
aim steady
lyricism sharp as machete
i got it already
see i was born to sell records
you was destined to sell tunes
all up your headphones
killing booths like cellphones
'cause everything ain't what is seems
it ain't just him it takes a team
at the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean
yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety
now i've had a lot of doubt
but i had to throw that out
'cause i find that they listen when i rhyme not when i shout
with me and my girl
see music is my moon but this shawty is my world
think about you all the time
'cause sometimes you can ignore me
but the beat listens just fine
tell me do you even know
if you truly want to grow
hate letters when i'm writing love jones all i know
'cause everything ain't what it seems

living a life you only dream about
flow angelic but now it's time to bring the demon out
can you feel me?
i said it's hard being a saint inside a sinner's body
you know its hard living as logic after living as bobby
this is the life i depicted
as a child i picked it
feeling conflicted
to music i am addicted
not one of y'all can predict it
so many bars i'm feeling convicted
now writing like a felon i'm selling homie who you telling
a level you ain't seen
a level that is truly only deemed for a king, 'cause
the second you listen it's my mission to murder any rendition
busting with precision
if you in my vision i'm never missing
logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener


i know what it's like
to be all, all depressed
and not wanna go out and
and live life man
that's not healthy man
you can't be living like that what's wrong with you?

hi
yeah hey you, yeah you
yeah yeah uh huh
i know you been feeling down
there's something's pissin you off
and something's wrong- you know what
we're gonna, i'm gonna cheer you up
i'm gonna help you out
just go ahead and just
and just listen all right?
here we go

hi there hey friend how are you
cheer on up you superstar you
don't let them try you
don't let them deny you
'cause you're gonna make it some day
and you're gonna make it some way
no more waitin for the bus
and no more riding on the subway
live life how you want to
so get on up now go get out there
face your fears
no need to be scared
you better rebel
and if they hate you give 'em hell
no more hiding in your shell
'cause we are not defined
by how hard we fall
so dust yourself off and stand tall
'cause you can make it
of this i'm sure
just spread your wings
and you will soar

i know
i know, know
that i'm gonna blow
you away
and when i wake up
i'm gonna shake up
and you're gonna love me
you're gonna take me
and not a single one of you
can tell me no
oh yeah

i'mma go where nobody before me has gone
and i know that the journey is gonna be long
livin' life like a mademan like a don
i was in the dark but now all the lights on
it's real hard on the rise to fame
cause everybody's mad and you're the one to blame
and just last year you didn't know my name - logic
now they all demand it
used to hate me and i can't stand it
'cause now you love me you so damn manic
said i'll never make it said i'll fail
my ship would sink
i know i'm gonna prevail
eyes on the prize right on my trail
middle finger to the haters that are on my tail
'cause i got heart boy i got spunk
feelin' just like jordan before the dunk
*ha* i'm just playin' around
oooowwwwww

i swear to god that i love the life i live
and i'm grateful for every breathe it gives
i remember thinkin' something's got to give
new day but it all just feels the same
no clouds but i can feel the rain
till i came across my own name
i wasn't in control of my destiny
feelin' empty thinkin' where's the rest of me
i gotta make it but i need the recipe
only then will i find the best of me
i was so selfish, i was so stuck
cleanin up food, for a little buck
then i quit that, livin' on luck
i was so lost, at what cost
why be the worker, when you could be the boss
still doin' wrong, trynna live right
get my mind righteous, man i what a fight
and my girl left, so i just might
so i just might
go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
happiness last, and uh
go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
happiness last, and uh


logic
will i make it i don't know
from the bottom of my heart i swear to god i gotta blow
this for every time the world told me no
if i don't make it in this game i ain't got nowhere else to go
from the drama to the hoes
from the records to the shows
i gotta make it, and if they don't give me what i deserve
then imma take it, i've been underrated, underestimated and hated
but i can't wait to look back and say that i made it
cause nowadays everyone's a rapper and i hate it

y'all don't know-oh-oh-oh-know-oh-oh-oh
said y'all don't know-oh-oh-oh-know-oh-oh-oh

i had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears
while you was out partying, chilling and sipping on some beers
i was sacrificing adolescent years
blood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is
and now i'm feeling, i'm feeling like the moment has arrived
with bobby is no longer living and logic has revived
lyricism that's driven from a master you bastards

just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way

logic
all i ever wanted was some financial security
now i'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather
high score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level
mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner
visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner
noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner

y'all don't know-oh-oh-oh-know-oh-oh-oh
said y'all don't know-oh-oh-oh-know-oh-oh-oh

just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way
just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way

logic
you know my steelo, busting shots like free throws
is it a blessing that i'm messing with girls
that wanna undress in the back of my car
or is it just 'cause i'm a star? or is it just 'cause i'm a star?
5 foot 7, looked like she fell from heaven
with an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend
she was black and asian, part hispanic and part amazing
women they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest
my heart only has one love like serena and venus
you know i am the meanest genius with the biggest-hey!
see baby girl i know you got some problems
just know i'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em
i swear i take care of all em' but you gotta trust it
love it, open your heart before you lust it
now bust it, what

just another day living in the hood
just another day living in the hood
just a-just another-just another-just another day
just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way
just another day living in the hood
just another day around the way


i got a date with destiny
my heart says yeah but can't convince the rest of me
i tried so hard to make it with no recipe
my selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
i need redemption no need to mention my past
cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
the glits the glamore the lights the camera the action
the stage the fans the speakers blastin'
you know i'm wanted i need it don't doubt it i can't live without it
it's just everything i dreamed of
it's everything i've ever wanted
but is it really truly in my plans
or did god mix up my blue prints
did he have it right there in his hands?

anybody give me a hint
i can feel it now i know it's coming
i've fallen i've risen i chose to select to dismiss an incarnation through these bars created-a prison
and i intend to do the time and the sentence that's given
25 to life yeah that's how i'm living
sometimes i wonder if i'll ever make it
but there's only way i'mma know
i'm like a seed planted in the dirt
feels like i've been waiting forever to grow
and maybe today is the day
but one thing that i know for sure
this time i'mma get it right


i don't want to rule or conquer anyone
i should like to help everyone if possible, jew, gentile, black man, white
we all want to help one another, human beings are like that
we all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery
we don't want to hate and despise one another
in this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone
the way of life can be free and beautiful. but we have lost the way
greed has poisoned men's souls
sinatra
'sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'is this what you want?'
logic
'you are watching a master at work'
'you have interfered with our affairs for the last time'
many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons
fans telling me never change, but it's harder fighting seasons
they hear me on the radio and now they yelling 'treason!'
cause logic giving them mainstreams like ephesians
but, i never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow
the fame hit me quicker than previously determined
motivated by money, sex, drugs and violence
cause the era that we living, it was built up on defiance
what we need is alliance, but y'all don't really hear me though
so, hip-hop's a chariot and logic's finna carry it
stallion, coming for their necks like a medallion
straight out of sierra leone

cutting records after the show at my hotel while i'm touring
yeah, and i ain't even 23
but my bank account can vouch, i'm balling like an mvp
yes it's me, l-o-g-i-c,
i'm repping md
i work 12 hours a day, every day with no distraction
7 days a week and 12 hours, that's a lazy day
going 74 hours with no sleep, call that a crazy day
this is manhunt, and i ain't stopping till y'all apprehended
many years i have attended and finally been commended
now, pull out the mac and watch them freeze like pcs
i educate 'em with ease, however listener please
don't knock that last line, school it just wasn't for me
we all different,
and i'm here to make a killing
so say hello to the villain cause in this day that we living
and the nice guys finish last
i'm blowing up
guess you could say i'm having a blast
'sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'you are watching a master at work'
'is this what you want?'


dead presidents iii, not to be confused with growing pains iii
logic this logic that, logic sick, logic wack
so many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease
waitin' on a record deal that's never cumming like a priest
black and white like a nun
these up-and-comers our sun
like the break of dawn
never knowin' what's gon' follow
however we never wallow in our sorrow
just pray for tomorrow
at times my heart could be hallow
emotions forced to be swallowed
while neighborhood cats blast star gas like the apollo
this is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
one moment she'll love you then swallow you whole like an anaconda
so with the lift of a pinky i'mma
dominate the world like my name was brain
spit flame like propane

allow me to kill it off the brink like no traffic
murderin' every demographic
paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
rip the mic to set the example
constant thoughts of suicide,
where living in an era that's do or die
society expects us to fail, i'm talking about you and i
but we persevere force fear enemies saying "we want nothing but peace and if not we leave 'em deceased"
in your central nervous system like heroine reppin' maryland to the fullest
bustin' like bullets that travel through chambers that are ignited by triggers don't pull it
i go from point a to point b by keeping it g
ain't no killer but don't push me
buckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steal
i have not a single enemy
only evil entities that have some how befriended me, in they mind
'cause i am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
and when it comes to dame's i catch plane's
they catch feelins
haters keep my name in they mouth like villains
high as the ceiling
y'all really don't know who your dealing with now
visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
i'm thankful for every breath i'm given
on the road to success and there ain't no time for collision
people ask "how you get your flow so amazing"

to which i reply "i have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions"
haters taken shots but i never graze 'em
now if pro is the opposite of con
what's the opposite of pro-gress
grew up on sex and they that i can attest
now if i don't believe it y'all won't perceive it
now run it back and retrieve it
only 22 but i feel like i'm 99
back in 1999 that's when i began to rhyme
surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know i shine
daddy was smokin' crack i was raised by a single mom
at 16 the school system dismissed him and wished him well
so i focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
i left home at 17
but she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
so many rappers biting me you would think they was teethin'
and now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story


yeah
chillin' with my homie sledro while he ignites the vapor
unless you talking suicide
'cause i finally gotta little bit of money and a range in my drive way
with a rattpack smoking on zimbabwe
crankin' sinatra that my way
visionary nothin' above it
get shorties wet when i rub it
carbon copies they dub it

you used to hate it
now you love it
smile in my face?
i think nothin' of it
yeah i'll shake your hand
kill em' with kindness

you used to hate it
now you love it
smile in my face?
i think nothin' of it
yeah i'll shake your hand
kill em' with kindness

yeah
educated in business but majored in sex appeal
my shorty she gotta
sportin' gucci louie and prada
looking beautiful in it all but i prefer nada
yeah, low maintenance and high scale
type of shorty that when you get locked up she pay the bail
i used to follow my dreams until i caught up to em'
it's never been done
watch me go platinum just for fun
far from materialistic but let me stunt son
you know what i be on, you know where i be at
the proof is within the numbers they slumber but now they react
i got 3 tapes, 0 tolerance one of the greats
the 301, smoking joints with your girl for fun
stand strong and never run unless the po go for the gun like

you used to hate it
now you love it
smile in my face?
i think nothin' of it
yeah i'll shake your hand
kill em' with kindness

you used to hate it
now you love it
smile in my face?
i think nothin' of it
yeah i'll shake your hand
kill em' with kindness

yeah
we snatch it like interception
met the girl of my dreams, her love resembled inception
her sign was a leo
me, her, and music that's the perfect trio
spanish hunny we met in rio, future lookin' cleo
so much money my pants saggin
vmg is up-to-date but these businessmen be lackin'
eve bit the apple, steve changed the world
getting money like zuckerburg, my bank account is sterol
i am not defined by that in which i do possess
i need drive in a lady, not a girl that drive me crazy
need a girl that don't care if a drive a honda or mercedes
spit fire like hades, i infect it like rabies
it's all that, shout out to them 90's babies
never hesitate to supply the heat
shortcut to the desktop, i am your newest icon
girl got them daddy problems that's why she be actin' tough
innocent in person, but in the bed she love it rough
running away from reality to sniff coke and puff
so, let me get it the second i spit it you know that i did it all the people wanna come around
they used to hate it, but now they love the sound

you used to hate it
now you love it
smile in my face?
i think nothin' of it
yeah i'll shake your hand
kill em' with kindness

you used to hate it
now you love it
smile in my face?
i think nothin' of it
yeah i'll shake your hand
kill em' with kindness


yeah, my name is riley, son
aka, riley escobar, know what i'm saying?
'cause i be in the streets you know?
i got all kinds of names like hr paper stacks
uh, also known as aka horse choker, uh

hey, yo, i'll chop you up in sixteen pieces
in front of your nieces, while i'm eating reese's
and won't even offer them any, yes i spit plenty
this is east coast flow at its finest
in the studio, where you find us, put a bullet where your spine is
at sixteen i was skipping school and smoking chronic
while you was learning about english, big l was teaching ebonics
i spit fire so demonic, writing code like i'm masonite
a jedi master breaking it down like old plaster
no medication for this track cause this is how a psycho rips
my bank account is like a cino bolt, your pocket's microchips, uh
whoop your ass and get arrested, in a double breasted
louis vuitton diamond encrested tailor made suit
now that's all sinatra everything
i explode like hollow tips on contact

chronologically murder schmoe there's no bringing joe back
puffing cubans and sipping cognac
mafietic mentality, introduce me to this beat and it's fatality
i kill mics like conrad murray
sharp like hanzo steel, the rest is obtuse
i get loose when sipping goose and rhyme like doc seuss
flow tight like noose, whoop ass like bruce, no time for a truce
alphabetical mathematic addict
i spit sixteens so erratic you think it was a semi-automatic
i know by now you thinking "oh my god, he let them have it"
but that was just a loan, time to collect like i'm capone
reep what i've sewn, in other words that is the throne
chilling while homies smoking marijuan'
cause for every emotion and every mood i have a song
for the club, for the streets, for the whip and for the sheets
cause this is where intellect and versatility meets
i'm young sinatra, backstage chilling with bobbysoxers
i got ya

yeah!


yeah; pass the mic before i jack it like gore-tex
bust like raw sex, rappers suck like vortex
the life of a don- we living like kings, and killing our pawns
boy, the seconds it's on - don't know where we going
that last line made no sense like these rappers' careers
but i make dollars, 'cause i'm all about the fiscal year
yeah; you don't like me? i'll conjure up and summon all your fears
you wanna fight me? i'll woop my own ass before you get here
wanna write me? and tell me that my rhymes suck?
you can ask my ex, i bust quicker than two techs
caressed by a kid with category 5 tourettes
in other words i squeeze with ease, dot my i's and cross my t's
it's hip-hop, not to be taken literally
however on the light of note i stayed with bills like hilary
my flow convects, murder subjects with little respect
best protect your neck, before you play my tape better inspect the deck
sike- i'm not that much of a dick when i rhyme
on another level like duplex, bust heads like suplex
slaughter mc's then ask who's next...
ey yo my crew next, but you say you next, so i guess we now
priceless flow so even if i write it's still a freestyle
never busting gats i ain't no gangster put that heat down
raise hell, like i'm satan's daddy while you in here

with the thickest fatty while i hit the gas, you lick it gladly
it's a fact that me and logic rip with vicious rap to list a wrap
we spittin' crack to keep the fiends, coming back to show world
reppin maryland but i make music for the whole world
seduce a chick with lyrics whenever she hear it, it make her toes curl
so sick i hope i don't hurl, if you love me let me go girl
spit it so thorough and in depth, i bet i leave in you impressed
only interest is to blow up, and watch they hands go up
'cause i used to throw shows back then but no one would show up
i ain't all about the money but i want it homie sho' nuff
cause krispie crazy bout' the cream, you could say i'm doughnuts
we exchanged a couple words, he said some things i didn't like
i said okay... then punched him in the face with a butcher knife

you will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
who told you see, i told you to do something uplifting
i'm tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
and i don't mean that in no nice way

i'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.
i'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.
i got something better than school but don't tell anybody.
my daddy would kill me so don't tell anybody.
he wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody.
he ain't walked in my shoes, i'm just not everybody.


oh when it all

man i promise, she's so self-conscious
she has no idea what she's doing in college
that major that she majored in don't make no money
but she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
now, tell me that ain't insecure
the concept of school seems so secure
sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
'cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs
'cause her baby-daddy don't really care
she's so precious with the peer pressure
couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off, now she look like eve
and she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
single black female addicted to retail and well

oh when it all, it all falls down

man i promise, i'm so self-conscious
that's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollies and pasha's done drove me crazy
i can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
then i spent four-hundred bucks on this
and i can't even go to the grocery store
without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
it seems we living the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
we trying to buy back our forty acres
and for that paper, look how low we a stoop


we buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
we-a buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
things we buy to cover up what's inside
'cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
that's why shorties holler, "where the ballers at?"
drug dealer buy jordans, crackhead buy crack
and a white man get paid off of all of that
but i ain't even gonna act holier than thou
before i had a house and i'd do it again
'cause i want to be on 106 and park pushin' a benz
i want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
i got a couple past due bills, i won't get specific
i got a problem with spendin' before i get it
we all self-conscious, i'm just the first to admit it


oh when it all, it all falls down
i'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

i's can't keep working like this
this grave shift is like a slave shift


one glad morning
when this life is over
i'll fly away
to a land where
joy shall never end
i'll fly away

oh i'll fly away, oh glory
i'll fly away
when i die hallelujah bye and bye
i'll fly away



man, man, man
if my manager insults me again, i will be assaulting him
let's go back, back to the gap, look at my check, wasn't no scratch
so if i stole, wasn't my fault, yeah i stole, never got caught
they take me to the back and pat me askin' me about some khakis
but let some black people walk in, i bet you they show off their token blackie
oh now they love kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
so i'm on break next to the "no smokin'" sign with a blunt in the mall
takin' my hits, writing my hits, writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
y'all don't know my struggle, y'all can't match my hustle
you can't catch my hustle, you can't fathom my love
dude, lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers
that's a different world like cree summer's, i deserve to do these numbers
"the kid that made that deserves that maybach"
so many records in my basement, i'm just waiting on my spaceship, wow


and i didn't even try to work a job, represent the mob at the same time
thirsty on the grind, chi state of mind, lost my momma, lost my mind
my life, my love, that's not mine, "why you ain't signed?" wasn't my time
leave me alone, work for y'all, half of it's yours, half of it's mine
only one to ball, never one to fall, got to get mine, got to take mine
got a tec-9, reach my prime, got to make these haters respect mine
in the mall until twelve when my schedule had said nine
putting them pants on shelves waiting patiently i ask myself
where i want to go, where i want to be
life is much more than running in the streets
holla at ye, hit me with the beat
put me on my feet, sound so sweet
yes i'm the same ol' g, same goatee, staying low key, nope
holler at god, "man why'd you have to take my folks?"
hope to see freddie g., yusef g, love my g
rolly g., police watch me smoke my weed, count my g's
got a lot of people counting on me and i'm just trying to find my peace
should've finished school like my niece then i finally wouldn't use my piece, blow
aw man, this pressure


man, you know you gon' do it
standing on my feet all damn day trying to make this thing right
and having one of my co-workers say "yo, you look just like
well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
no more broad service, cars, and them tv shows
i had all that snatched from me, a&amp;rs and they faculties
all turn their back on me and didn't want to hear a rap from me
so naturally actually had to face things factually
had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
'cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
i don't want to ever go back there
so i won't be taking no days off till my spaceship takes off


i want to fly, i want to fly
i said i want my chariot to pick me up and take me, brother, for a ride
heaven knows, heaven knows


yo
we at war
we at war with terrorism, racism
and most of all, we at war with ourselves


you know what the midwest is? young and restless
i walk through the valley of the chi where death is
top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
try to catch it, it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
they be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
we ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
a trunk full of coke, rental car from avis
my mama used to say only jesus can save us
well mama i know i act a fool
but i'll be gone till november, i got packs to move, i hope



now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see thee more clearly
i know he hear me when my feet get weary
'cause we're the almost nearly extinct
we rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
i ain't here to argue about his facial features
or here to convert atheists into believers
i'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
the way kathie lee needed regis, that's the way i need jesus
so here go my single dog, radio needs this
they say you can rap about anything except for jesus
that means guns, sex, lies, videotape
but if i talk about god my record won't get played, huh?
well if this take away from my spins
which'll probably take away from my ends
then i hope this take away from my sins
and bring the day that i'm dreamin' about
next time i'm in the club, everybody screamin' out



oh baby
hahahahaha, turn it up for me


yo, first i snatched the streets then i snatched the charts
first i had they ear, now i have their heart
rappers came and went, i've been here from the start
i seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
seen the rovers roll up with ribbons
i seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
so when i reload, he holds number one position, when you hot, i'm hot
and when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
this is not an image, this is god given
this is hard livin', mixed with cristal sippin'
it's the most consistent, hov
give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
it's hov tradition, jeff gordon of rap
i'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy


down for my grandfather who took my mama
made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
at the tender age of six she was arrested for the sit-ins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
but we can make it to jacob's and to the dealership
swear i hear new music and i just don't be feelin' it
racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
but i know they don't want me in the damn club
they even made me show id to get inside of sam's club
i done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
swear i've been baptized least three or four times
it's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
so i promised to mr. rainey i'm gonna marry your daughter
and you know i gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you see the car i bought her
you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
but i can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'cause look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watching me from the other side

when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i found, one thing i found
oh no you'll never let me down

we are all here for a reason on a particular path
you don't need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math
cats think i'm delirious but i'm so damn serious
that's why i expose my soul to the globe; the world
i'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
i'm not just another individual
my spirit is a part of this that's why i get spiritual
but i get my hymns from him
so it's not me, it's he that's lyrical
i'm not a miracle, i'm a heaven sent instrument
my rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
for your soul and your mental
that's why i'm instrumental, vibrations is what i'm into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that ain't what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
i'm trying to get us "us free" like cinque
i can't stop, that's why i'm hot
determination, dedication, motivation
i'm talking to you of my many inspirations
when i say i can't let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
and if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
in my grip i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it be known that god's penmanship has been signed
with a language called love
that's why my breath is felt by the deaf
and while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess i'm one of a kind in a full house
'cause whenever i open my heart, my soul or my mouth

when it comes to being true, at least true to me
one thing i found, one thing i found
oh no you'll never let me down
get up i get, get up i get
get up i get, get up i get

built the roc from a pebble, peddled rock before i met you
let you tell it man i'm falling, well somebody must have caught him
every fourth quarter, i like to mike jordan them
number one albums what i got, like four of them
more of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
clear the way, i'm here to stay
y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
this is jay, dissing jay will get you maced
six hail mary's please father forgive us
they way y'all all follow jigga
hov's a living legend and i'll tell you why
everybody wanna be hov and hov's still alive

down, down
down, down
down, down


uh, uh, i'm trying to catch the beat
uh, i'm trying to catch the beat
i'm trying to catch the beat
uh, uh, i'm trying to catch the beat

now i ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
and if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high

n-n-n-now, my flow is in the pocket like wallets, i got the bounce like hydraulics
i can't call it, i got the swerve like alcoholics
my freshman year i was going through hella problems
till i built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
my teacher said i's a loser, i told her, "why don't you kill me?"
my heart, and if you follow the charts or the plaques or the stacks
you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
i'm so shy that you thought i was bashful
but this bastard's flow will bash your skull
and i will, cut your girl like pastor tro'
and i don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
and i won't, give you that money that you asking for
why you think me and dame cool? we assholes
that's why we hear your music in fast forward

now i ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
and if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high

telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly

or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
y'all assumed i was doomed, out of tune
real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
control rap is out of
used to, but still got love
that's why i abuse you who are not thugs, rock clubs like tiger
woods in the hood, to have my own reality show, called soul survivor
how could i ever let your words affect me?
they say hip hop is dead, i'm here to resurrect me
marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
that's why the raw don't know your name, like alicia keys
too many featured emcees, and producers is popular
twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
album, how come? you the hot garbage of
the year's clear your image and snooped up

you dancing for money like honey, i did this my way
so when the industry crash, i survive like kanye
spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'

these are documented, my father left them to me
and i'm going to leave them to my kids
i'm going to learn too
i'm going to get super smart, so i, too, can die without money

i'd like to propose a toast

so get your ass up off the wall

the all around the world digital underground pac
the rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the roc
i take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
ain't nobody expect kanye to end up on top
they expected that college dropout to drop and then flop
then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
my money was thinner than sean paul's goatee hair
now jean paul gaultier cologne fill the air, here
they say he bougie, he big-headed
would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
flow infectious, give me ten seconds
i'll have a buzz bigger than insects in texas
it's funny how wasn't nobody interested

so get your ass up off the wall

now was kanye the most overlooked? yes sir
now is kanye the most overbooked? yes sir
though the fans want the feeling of a tribe called quest
but all they got left is this guy called west
that'll take freeway, throw him on tracks with mos def
call him kwali or kweli, i put him on songs with jay-z
i'm the gap like banana republic and old navy, and ooh
it come out sweeter than old sadie
nice as bun-b when i met him at the source awards
girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards
and i was almost famous, now everybody love kanye, i'm almost raymond
some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
it was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
last year shoppin' my demo, i was tryin' to shine
now i could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
i use it as my gas, so they say that i'm gassed
but without it i'd be last, so i ought to laugh
so i don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
i'm kan, the louis vuitton don
bought my mom a purse, now she louis vuitton mom
i ain't play the hand i was dealt, i changed my cards
i prayed to the skies and i changed my stars
i went to the malls and i balled too hard
"oh my god, is that a black card?"
i turned around and replied, "why yes
but i prefer the term african american express"
brains, power, and muscle, like dame, puffy, and russell
your boy back on his hustle, you know what i've been up to
mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips

so get your ass up off the wall, all

so this a&amp;r over at roc-a-fella, named hip hop picked the "truth" beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me, you know, like i always do
i play the songs, he's like "who that spittin'?" i'm like "it's me," he's like "oh, well okay"
uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
just askin' me to send him beats, and i'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin' with
and um, he was friends with my mentor, no id
and no id told him, "look man, you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"
i was all, i dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
i was messin' with, uh, d-dot also
people were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how i got in the game
if it wasn't for that, i wouldn't be here
i was stayin' in chicago, i had my own apartment, i be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and buy, get a pelle pelle off layaway, get some jordans or something or get a technomarine, that's what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample
and at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me
so i went and um, i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time and really i just, like bit the drums off "xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled
and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "this can't be life"
and that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know, i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management
i really wanted to roll with hip hop 'cause i, i just needed some fresh air, you know what i'm sayin' 'cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
and that day, i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said, "oh you a real soulful dude"
and he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take
and he said, "tell me what you think of this"
and i heard it, and i was thinking like, "man, i really wanted more like of the simple type jay-z"
i ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion
so he asked me, "what you think of it?"
you know what i'm sayin', man what i'mma tell him?
i was on the train, man, you know
so after that i went back home and man i'm, i'm just in chicago, i'm trying to do my thing
you know, i got groups, i got acts i'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like, poppin' off the way it should have been
one of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed
but it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company
so, like i'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company
and i got evicted at the same time
so i went down and tracked the beats from him
so i ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk
me and my mother drove to newark, new jersey
i hadn't even seen my apartment
you know, we went to ikea, i bought a bed, i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat i made was, uh, "heart of the city"
and beans was still working on his album at that time, so i came up there to baseline, it was beans' birthday, matter of fact, and i played like seven beats
and, you know i guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, i had did "nothing like it" already at that time
but then jay walked in, i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
i remember it like, like it was yesterday
and hip hop said, "yo play that one beat for him"
so i played "heart of the city" and really i made "heart of the city," i really wanted to give that beat to dmx
and i played another beat, and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, "ooh"
two days later, i'm in baseline and i seen dame
dame didn't know who i was and i was like, "yo, what's up i'm kanye"
so, jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days
i gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story
the day i did the 'can't be life' beat on track, i remember lenny s., he had some louis vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly
and hip hop was there, i think ty-ty, john meneilly, a bunch of people
i didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and i said, "yo jay i could rap"
mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips"
and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line
that was it, you know, i ain't get no deal then, haha
okay, fast forward
so, blueprint, "h to the izzo," my first hit single
and i just took that proudly, built relationships with people, my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
man, yo, i appreciate, i love him for that
and at this time, you know i didn't have a deal, i had songs, and i had relationships with all these a&amp;r's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, i'd play them some beats
"gimme a beat that sound like jay-z," you know, they dick riders, whatever
be like, "yo but i rap too." hey, i guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here, i played them "jesus walks" and they didn't sign me
i'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
let's just say i didn't get my deal
the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol records
he wanted to sign me really bad
dame was like, "yo you got a deal with capitol? okay man, just make sure it's not wack"
then one day i just went ahead and played it, i wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know cam was in the room, young guru, and
dame was in the room
so i played, actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe i might use it
so, it's called "wow"
"i go to jacob with twenty-five thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
i got eleven plaques on my walls right now
don't bite that chorus, i might still use it
"i ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot"
like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper
and i'm sure dame figured, "like man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album, you know
so uh dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, b, b, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"
"you gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on"
i told hip hop and hip hop was all, "oh, word?"
actually, even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3h
that, you know, 'cause i told him i was gonna do it, and i'm a man of my word, i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do
then, you know, i'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer rapper" and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol, and right
the day i'm talking about, i planned out everything i was gonna do man, i had picked out clothes
i already started booking studio sessions, i started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man i was ready to go
and they had mel call me, they said, "yo
capitol pulled on the deal"
and, you know i told them that roc-a-fella was interested
and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever
i went up
i called g, i said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with roc-a-fella?"

so won't you raise your glass, won't you?
so won't you raise your glass, won't you?
so won't you raise your glass, won't you?
so won't you raise your glass, won't you?

but they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
i guess they want us all behind bars, i know it

uh, and i heard 'em say
"nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
and i heard 'em say
"nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
but we'll a find a way
it hurts but it may be the only way)

they say people in your life are seasons
and anything that happen is for a reason
and gram keep praying and keep believing
in jesus, and one day that you see him
till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
the devil is alive i feel him breathin'
claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
and put them lottery tickets just to tease us
my aunt pam can't put them cigarettes down
so now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
i can't figure it out, i'm sick of it now

uh, and i heard 'em say
"nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
and i heard 'em say
nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
but we'll a find a way
it hurts but it may be the only way)

with every worthless word, we get more far away
and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
and nothing last forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way

drove by the teachers, even more by polices
how'd he get the cash? the day his father passed away

seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
pray to god that my arms reach the masses
the young smoke grass in grassless jungles
rubber band together in cashless bundles
we wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
someone to stay in they corner like mike tyson
hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
children are unheld, i wish love was for sale
behold the pale horse got me trapped like r. kell, i bail and it

might not be such a bad idea if i never, never went home again
i'm on my way home
i left three days ago, but no one seems to know i'm gone
home is where the hatred is
home is filled with pain and it
might not be such a bad idea if i never, never went home again

'cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up,
you coming to the ville, you gotta get a license from us,
city on my back, i feel like i'm holding big pun up,
this is cocaine on flames, baking soda and water,
and if you feel that, then i guess i sell crack, get it?
so many hoes whipped, you woulda thought we still in slavery.
from them nc streets where beef they deliver,
and the clip is on 'e' 'cause your chest got a filla.
bred like guerillas getting bread,

and i'm on it, waiting for a target.
i'm just getting green like a yard or a garden.
chicken noodle soup, now i'm filet mignon.'

i survived the ville,
but a lot will not, so they will glocks and bonnevilles
money hungry, tryna find a meal.
can't stay inside and chill,
lying like they on the pill,
preachers say we blessed,
but all we feel is stressed, tryna deal.
my mind is still- racing, i'm tryna kill- snakes,

it's kinda ill how i'm giving y'all that carolina feel,
it's kinda ill how i'm giving y'all that carolina feel,

yeah,
yo, coming home, y'all,
listen,

at any given time, got the city on my mind,
the city on my mind,
the city on my mind,
i'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine,
the city, it is mine,
the city, it is mine,
at any given time, carolina on my mind,
carolina on my mind,

carolina on my mind,
i'm tryna go for mine,
i'm tryna go for mine,
hey,

perfect vision i'm 20/20 for this money, g,
see it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show,
'cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose,
money goes, the money come.
barely twenty-one, i'm thinking big things,
momma in the mansion with the fish tanks,
the carolina way.
if you in college then you know the crime won't pay,
'cause in carolina- we thorough,
and up in winston, and raleigh, did i mention?
tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo,
no matter the city, man, carolina shine, regardless!
yeah,

riding big in an ol' school chevy
with the windows down when i'm rolling through my city, like,
ooh!
she can hear me down the street, she like 'ooh!'
blew game and i do my thing,
ain't tryna settle down, i ain't shopping for no ring,
oh no!
carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
ooh!


yeah,
feel my pain,
look,
yo-
was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,
bird chest, legs skinny,
that hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next penny,
fresh pennies on my feet,
momma paid for everything i'm wearing,
at the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.
now i'm a man worried about my fam.
let me explain,
feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,
and it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.
at the same time they moms pray for them.
ask the lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,
it hurts on the usual,
the only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.

i don't know if i'll see tomorrow,
i won't stop- try till the day i die,

i sit back and watch the news every now and then,
either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,
even the weathers bad.
yesterday this kid got his whole frame split,
only seventeen, he was finna to graduate.
some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop,
wait, man she just eleven!

plus the cops harassing us,
every week be blasting us, on accident- or so they claim.
they killed her only son,
make her wanna blow her brains out,

i don't know if i'll see tomorrow,
i won't stop- try till the day i die,

take a ride through the city man,
and tell me what you witness,
poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits,
violence, hatred, real devastation,


g-eazy the slap doctor presents the epidemic

the other day seen this girl walk by the other way
i would have spoke but when i looked at her she looked the other way
had it been another day i would have grabbed her by the hand
you don't know who i am but see i love the way you smile
do you got a man i'd be honored if i can walk with you for a second
i said if you ain't got no plans
i'm trying to get to know you 'cause you're the type i go to
the type i write a song and make a beat about and flow to
anything to show you how beautiful you are
but you don't know it yet
maybe i'll approach you next time and let you know exactly how i feel about you
until then i think of how fly it would be if it were her and i
the apple of my urban eye
and next time no lie i guess i'll try 'cause i

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

it was one week later when i peeped her at the bus stop
laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
i walked over but i still couldn't do it
it was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
see fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
and i'm never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
they leave wounds and they scab and they pus
just when i was thinking that i look up and seen the bus
come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
that's when i could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
i put my eighty-five cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
and i was extra sure until somebody sat first
damn i guess my story got to wait until next verse

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

it was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of july
but she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
so this my opportunity to try and get at her
"is it cool if i sit?" and then a smile was her reply
i sat down and started talking to her
be careful of what i say 'cause i ain't want to sound awkward to her
said i been peeping you but i ain't never spoke
and i figured if i try i probably choke
then she laughed and looked at me acting like i told a joke
and said "joke for what? lighten up, real talk i been trying"
and plus i always see you with him and she laughed again
but what she said next took me for a spin

i saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
to wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
forbidden juices had me so weak

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

last week i had a thought i'm 20 years
that's old enough to start imagining and plenty fears
or will i go 'cause i don't fit in here with any peers
know there's more to life than smokin' weed and drinkin' many beers
and partyin' but what else to do
when needin' a lord of fame isn't helping you
wish i could tell jay-z i see myself in you
i started with a dream and now i'm tryna be wealthy too
but its tough when your balancin' it all
and walkin' down a tight rope you balance bought to fall
the label's keep tellin' me i'm talented and all
but i need another candy girl to really have it all
i'm hungrier than ever for a check
and plus my situations not at all what you'd expect
i work my ass off, i'm always stickin' out my neck
'cause they say the real currency ain't cash but respect
but if you have one without the other
i hate bein' broke, but havin' all the fame
and not havin' to deal and have to be the blame
i wanna win bread and bring it home so after all we can live right
and give half of it to mom just to get right
and just to prove to her, i know she wasn't psycho
for always supportin' this dream, she was right though
but its tough when life's as stormy as the weather
and her health isn't gettin' any better
and everyday's a struggle, the most recent trouble was her job
she caught me cryin', told me she was laid off, god
but she told me, keep my spirits up high
she workin' i'll just keep on pushin', aimin' for the sky
and people wonder why i spend everyday high
cause my life isn't how its supposed to be, but i try
keep feelin' that i'm livin' life wrong
but then i stop trippin' as soon as i hit the bong
i go out to the club, pretend my problems all gone
i see chicks at my shows, know the words to my songs
my new girl told me "g" please promise me
if we gon' be together, you gon' have to give me honesty
and honestly i'm tryin' baby listen
i'm tryna do the best that i can for you
i feel that you deserve that and i care for you
cause while a groupie might love you when your big
soon as the fame goes, they ain't there for you real
a rappers girlfriend, best spot for a wife
and this is just to give a snap shot of my life
for all you haters gossipin' and speakin' all freely
feelin' like you know me cause you listen to my cd
because i'm in the lime light, you can go and start
this is just to tell you what the business is, this is it
this is it, yeah i'm sick of it
if i ain't care i swear i'd probably be fine

damn

and that's real

this is me


i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big

i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big

i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big

how the hell else i'mma ever feed kids
all bad you know what it is
honestly i'm just waiting on the right deal on the table
truthfully i've met with like 5 labels
they fly me, put me in a hotel and dine me
but they all say that it's early to sign me
i'mma make it on my lonely, y'all sound phony
so no lie i'mma make it one day
if i had one wish i would say

i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big

i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big

see and everybody raps, but they don't act fly
now i ain't on, and everybody ask why
i'm on the phone with the industry on standby
and i feel like i'm watching everybody pass by
rocked with chiddy bang at his very first show
year passed by, now he's booked on the road
everybody's getting deals, i'm saying where's mine
everybody keep asking me why i ain't signed
did a show with donnis out in nyc
big ups to that i'm just trying to survive
hungry wondering when my train will arrive
do my own production, i'm good with the words
i appeal from the hood to the burbs
spots right in front of me i'm trying my hardest to emerge
but there's no greater pressure than an artist on the verge

i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big

i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, i wanna be big
i wanna be big, big, big, big, big
big, big

and they all wanna chill and have fun."
i said, "got weed?" he said, "got blunt?"
i said, "off top, man, you already know
and if you wanna bottle, we can go to the sto'
and if we run out we can go and get mo'."
they all came through, swisher sweet, saw and
got a pack, and burn five blunts down back-to-back

all my homies sold weed, they was self-paid
self-made, young entreprenuers, selling dime bags
to the herb connoisseurs. this is good fashion
to burn my tree, come back next period
reeking a lead, and my teachers would know it was me
so i got a five day suspension, like every other week

sitting back in the chair
thinking about the last time
the words were put on temporary delay
so what the hell was i supposed to say?
you walked away

i tried to not think about it at all
tossed and turned in my sleep
until your vision was gone
with a few drinks and a couple of tears
i should be over this in just a couple of years
addicted to the feeling of being a crush
maybe i'll just drive 'cause it gives me a rush
i can't slow it down so i crash and burn
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you, without you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic, i need you, i feel you

doctor, doctor please prescribe me a prescription
some antiseptics for my affliction
it's getting worse; i've got a terrible condition
but it's what happens when you're dealing with addiction
see, i'm missing my love
i miss what it was, the kisses and hugs
yo, the way i'm missing her got me thinking its drugs
like cupid upgraded from arrows to slugs

i tried not thinking about it at all
tossed and turned in my sleep till your vision was gone
with a few drinks and a couple of tears
i should be over this in just a couple of years
addicted to the feeling of being a crush
maybe i'll just drive 'cause it gives me a rush
i can't slow it down so i crash and burn
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you, without you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic, i need you, i feel you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you, without you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you, without you

look, i need to go to rehab
for what we had
and i admit i never expected it to be bad
but losing you got me falling like my knees bad
she keep asking me how i can be mad
i let her go in the first place
had to do it
stupid but you've always been the first face
i keep in mind when i rhyme and write songs
missing all your lingerie and tight thongs
just a little nasty, but always kept it classy
flashy, but humble enough to still attract me
and i still keep your picture in my wallet
call it what you call it
i'm a damn loveaholic

i tried not thinking about it at all
tossed and turned in my sleep till your vision was gone
with a few drinks and a couple of tears
i should be over this in just a couple of years
addicted to the feeling of being a crush
maybe i'll just drive 'cause it gives me a rush
i can't slow it down so i crash and burn
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you, without you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic, i need you, i feel you

oh, try not to think about it all
the butterflies inside will eventually fall
try not to think about it now
i will find someone, just tell me how

they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you, without you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic, i need you, i feel you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic without you, without you
they call me a loveaholic
i don't feel like i can solve it
now i feel so diabolic, i need you, i feel you


these girls wanna tie a kid down and keep me around
but i would never change; i'm a dog, i'm a hound
but i told them what they wanna hear
they like how it sounds
tell them i'm gone with the wind and i'm lost, never found
i met her at my show, then we smashed right after
if we go three rounds then she'll fall in love faster
the very next morning i'm casper
in another city for a show somewhere getting plastered
it's a disaster; to her i'm a drug
i do her kinda dirt, but they still fall in love
and i don't understand it
foreign chicks on me
and she speak another language like she from a different planet
she struggle when i'm gone
it's hard when i leave
being ricky pen, wear my heart on my sleeve
and she tell me that she love me but it's hard to believe
'cause i'm coming and going, then i cum then i leave
and i swear i'm really not that shady
but you can't blame me for who i've met lately
nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
but i do play along, yo i can't front
i give in to every groupie with a fat butt
london to japan
hong kong to iran
chicks say i'm the man


and everywhere i go, these girls in my ear
and everywhere i go, these girls in my ear
and everywhere i go, these girls in my ear
and everywhere i go, these girls in my ear


the other day seen this girl walk by the other way
i would have spoke but when i looked at her she looked the other way
had it been another day i would have grabbed her by the hand
you don't know who i am but see i love the way you smile
do you got a man i'd be honored if i can walk with you for a second
i said if you ain't got no plans
i'm trying to get to know you 'cause you're the type i go to
the type i write a song and make a beat about and flow to
anything to show you how beautiful you are
but you don't know it yet
maybe i'll approach you next time and let you know exactly how i feel about you
until then i think of how fly it would be if it were her and i
the apple of my urban eye
and next time no lie i guess i'll try 'cause i

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

it was one week later when i peeped her at the bus stop
laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
i walked over but i still couldn't do it
it was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
see fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
and i'm never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
they leave wounds and they scab and they pus
just when i was thinking that i look up and seen the bus
come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
that's when i could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
i put my eighty-five cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
and i was extra sure until somebody sat first
damn i guess my story got to wait until next verse

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

it was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of july
but she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
so this my opportunity to try and get at her
"is it cool if i sit?" and then a smile was her reply
i sat down and started talking to her
be careful of what i say 'cause i ain't want to sound awkward to her
said i been peeping you but i ain't never spoke
and i figured if i try i probably choke
then she laughed and looked at me acting like i told a joke
and said "joke for what? lighten up, real talk i been trying"
and plus i always see you with him and she laughed again
but what she said next took me for a spin

i saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
to wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
forbidden juices had me so weak

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by

i wish i could show you exactly how i feel for you
if i was not so shy i'd talk to you when you walk by



uh, this wasn't typical for me don't confuse it
only thing i've ever loved before you was music
i guess you never know what you have till you lose it
i know soon you'll probably see it all clear
and realize you lost a real love
who was here for you unconditionally, but it's ugly
now years down the line, you reminisce to the point you shed a tear
but i'll be long gone and i never will appear in you're life no more
so gimme 'bout a year, turn on the radio and i'll be all that you can hear
and you'll be mad you ever went and let me disappear
now it's only my dreams that i run to
it just sucks that one of them will never come true
you cocked back and shot me down witch'ya gun boo
and i still got the wounds that'll prove it
took the energy, that's what i go into the booth with
now i write a song from my heart, you abuse it
and paint the picture of a love lost
now i know i can't afford the price love cost
feelin' feeble and weak from the blood loss seeping from my chest
now i know it just ain't what it once was


and since you peaced every day has been a struggle to
maintain sane when i know i'm still in love with you
and i know i'm buggin' too, wishin' i could let it go and stop thinkin' 'bout you
but i can't forget it though
somebody please pinch me, i just gotta wake up
i just keep missin' how it was before the break up
stuck in the past when you were my ace
i just hope you know you could never be replaced
it burns like mace in my face, a vodka shot straight no chase, when i think of us being erased
but you don't feel the same, showin' no empathy
aha ha, it is what it is, take it how you want it."

listen, i came in the game feet first
hit the ground runnin', a hustler till i meet dirt
gotta be consumption i'm pumpin, the people need work
the long-armed khalifa reachin' with each verse
i got that food for your thought, plus what the streets thirst
and you can ask around the haters'll know,
i'm tame with the flow, i'm sorta like the jaeger and blow
i see the dream like a martin luther, i preach to the constitution in peace,
but violate it, get that ass annihilated
i'm on the grind, money is time so why waste it
and everything but my piss clean, i'm high maintenance
the canon blast your candy ass if you try and hate it,
i made it, 'cause i stayed a couple steps ahead of y'all and
a hundred percent, since benji got the bread involved i'm,
i'm leavin' heads hollowed like them things stuffed in the clips
and the streets gon' remember this cat name, i'm beatin' the rap game
we make it happen the clappin know we can scrum with you
yeah we can take it to the heads, give you a lump or two
a fool is still, team bring heat like a oven dude


this is pure skill, far from damned luck,
you gotta make a plan to never give your man up
and man up, to positively stand up

once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer
how could a bystander feel that this is not bananas?
we earn stripes, you all hype in that propaganda,
gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras,
back glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up,
stuck in my ways, the haze taste like tropicana,
thinkin' the days of way back, people will say that,
the youngin was gifted sick when he stayed back
now the people listenin play back, i got it made
obligated to gettin' passin grades and blaze tracks,
you'll be amazed at how i make units move
self-made, twelfth grade, boy i'll take you to school
i'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move,
and you can find me speedin, listenin to big and em,
fresh outta class with the weed tucked in my timberlands



it's wiz khalifa man

now don't blink cause the flow is closer, don't think
true diplomat, no jim jones and no pink
and the city wanna know what, except that i claim
blackout be the gang, it's attached to my veins
and i don't got a problem giving naps to elaine
order every syllable, every rap to my name, ye
the grim reaper came back with a cane
that's me, spittin' crack to your brain
damn your man's handy
and i'm the mayor when i blam with them hands
have you seeing stars like you walk with them grammies
your reign was short, i'm running it now
knock your teeth out for biting, now you be gunning my style
i keep it, honey i'm selling them, i'm the blackout
put my sneakers to your face, you'll be running your mouth

man, it's too late

and some say i'm contradictory
'cause i flow nice and spit i mean, trying to get green
play it how i split teams
six two, feeling glock with a sick lean
big dreams, only two words, get green
which means never had no job
i spit, to keep it simple, the truth like no lies
no god, i know why
i make it clear, there's no reason for your life
and i make it ahead, see me speeding and blow by

you dudes fake, i see through you with closed eyes
and won't stop, till they can get rich
and make pay from the rap i spit
it ain't hard to tell, like a snitch, that i'm next on deck
and care less about who making the pay
listen, it's too late

it's too late man
it's too late
y'all dudes fake, pray for me

you catch rabies if you bite this hair
safe to say i don't like to share, ye
you see i'm what the ladies want, so they like to stare
i'm a beast, i eat tracks and bite the snare
see i got blind eyes and they like the glare
and i'll battle anybody who can fight the fan
spit, crack, put the pipe in their ears
shots split a clown into sections
round your protection, i'm back at it like a crack addict
the fact i spit crack dog, i'm ass-backwards
i lay it down, bring a clown to his knees
see, we be a truce in d, ye

it's too late
it's too late man
it's too late


i move with the dudes that be dishin weight,
smooth with the uz that will hit your face,
came in the game,
and i'm changin the game, with a flow that'll run around the crews that hate
this guy is a pimp and you know this fam, i don't hold the grams of a colder man
and i do it for the youngins and the older fans,
i don't play around, lay 'em down, for the little homie wanna play the clown
i came to pounce, spray your rounds,
money in a rubber band, slangin crack rock
so you did it round a man with a flat top,
ask anyone in the streets, everyone around know wiz a beast
and i'm killin' a beef you could chill on the team, pull the steal and relase,
i'm up in your brain, you bet on me takin' a loss, you better be cuffin yo chain.
see this guy here is a nuisance, you talk fly and can't prove it
when its well know that y'all can't see me

p-i, t-t-s, b-u, r-g-h,
represent to the fullest and i'm puttin' cowards back in the place,
when i"m rappin' their taste,
they ain't crackin' a place, laugh in your face, lay up and chill, after you say,
that's a mistake,
'cause i'm all over a gang of ill guys lookin' like their lives out of date.
knock down, never see the light of day,
get in that chest and i hide away,
so i never give the cats a ride away,
fire inside that made the kid move through the fools on the right to take the game,
back to the time of the rhymin age, came back for the fact that guys are fakin,
chips and just leave you with kids, that leave you see through your bricks,
moved some crack how true is that, front on my cats you'll lose your back,
finna get stacks till i'm through with rap, and i've been on my tracks with truth in fact,

everytime you get mad when i ask you what you do what you do
seems that you're runnin' around
and i don't know what to do
'cause i feel like you're lyin' to me when i'm askin you

pullin stunts and
rollin' blunts
with my dudes from the hood
but to you they no good
i'm just doin' what i could
and that's givin' the circumstances
you only get one shot at these certain chances
instead of trying to find dirt
and where your manners
try and understand when that work demanded
and no mama that's not a punch line
i'm always there when its crunch time
but still you say


everytime you get mad when i ask you what you do what you do
seems that you're runnin' around
and i don't know what to do
'cause i feel like you're lyin' to me when i'm askin you
sometimes...

not really knowin' what these streets like
so you stay up until i come back
help me relax
warm plate an the dub sack
and after that proceed the bend the back
then i'm back to politics the usual
and sometimes i wanna talk to get through to you

hit 'em with that 'oh no', now i'm record breaking here
see this that slow flow you heard of
seeing mo dough and re-ing more dro to burn up
keep it low though before the po-po swerve up
pull us to the side and them homos search us
gotta keep the work up, 'cause i was taught supply-demand
smoking putting pistolvania on the map 'cause i'm the man
hustle hard plus the ladies love the nasty flow, scrappy know


yeah it's young wiz ain't nobody do it how i done it son
killed 'em with the first and gotta hit 'em with another one
for you to pittsburgh ditty-bop to the beat with
fresh with my a-1's, keep a leaning fitted cap
we in a marathon you cats are lapped to me
khalifa still the same, ain't nothing change but my change
and my foot got a lil deeper up in the game
it's hard seeing through all this reefer up in my brain
let the trunk bang while you weaving and switching them lanes
hope if you in the club let 'em know you moving through
to pop something, roll something, man do what you do
18, making major moves that's why they hate me brother


let me make it clear, when that cake appear
moving these units they coming back for what i'm supplying
i'm the youngest in charge spittin' that real raw
my dutchies real long plus i work real hard
or how to switch states, get cake from a mixtape
couple hundred-thousand off my face from myspace
you'll be frustrated from tryna keep up with my pace
how i control the track you fools get over-lapped
you'll get left in the dust just cause you lesser than us
and coming at the kid? simply said it's just pressing ya luck
see i was hungry on this grind when you was lazy brother


i'm so incredible wait

wit no metal to waist

i flow great

and that'll level ya face


you talk greasy but you still a faggot


i got my money right

game on top

and it's been said that i'm the key to put this game on lock

i'm from tha city

of the triflin' hoods

but when you see me

gotta smile on my face

nuttin sweet, it's just that life is good

yeah, i dodged the hood

slums came up out that

rap game about that

to gain pay wit out crack

see i'mma youngin wit too much on my plate

to let some small change have a youngin dumped in a cage



and take lives, they worries ain't jail

wit no regards for life 'cause they livin' ain't well

who gotta make it to heaven 'cause they livin' in hell

but me i don't do much just keep to myself


i was told the world's cold but i see for my self

and i'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf

so i'm here

for sum reason though they hate it to death

the love's gone only hatred is left

only achin' and stress

a king not be mistaken for less

and this here is for the taking

this is history in the making

where i'm from it's kinda hard to trust

cause the hate's from most of your own people

they're fake and they're all see through


rather him be down in the dumps

and out on his luck

but i'll be damned if my grind stop

my mind tickin' like the time watch

and i'm gon be spittin' till the time's not

presently there

i touch minds everywhere

and i'll ride hopin' heaven is near

see the pain in your eyes young wit every stare

i seek peace, but these streets will never be fair

cause somebody went and took greg's life

son reached

deceased

no time to blink or think twice damn

wonder when it gonna be my time

to meet death

i'm stressed need to ease my mind

and unless one of y'all try to see what's mine

then i'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine

u see i did the right thing

i stayed up out the gun and knife game

i knew about the pain it might bring

and we all got problems

i chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em

the top, but i rose from the bottom

and i'm here now

ain't no body harming young

my screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young

ya time's up i'm just warning young

cause this here's for the taking,

this is history in the making


"never too late, too late to start start, never too late, too late to start start"

i'm tryna have the wrist all bladed up
with all kitted up
spit it like my last song, one life live it up
so please don't approach me man
like this a free show, cause you don't know me me fam
and please don't extend your hands like you know we fam
and please don't pretend like we only scram
where was all this love at when i was only can?
when i was tryna sell y'all my only jam?
i don't keep friends, i'm my only fan
and take falls, i'll never, i will only stand
ima make this all riches, is what i totally did
if you don't know me now, then how you know me then?
and i hope y'all loving the kid, but if not, its

"never too late, too late to start start, never too late, too late to start start"

i'm tryna have the strip all whipped out
crib all pimped out
chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out
flat on the front side, back all sticking out
but you gone have to slow up love
tryna skee 'cause she think ima blow up 'cause
all she thinking me getting her nails done, and her hair done
ma i'm not the one
ion need no chick plotting all my tricks

no birds tryna fly with me on my trips,
if i am with a miss, she a down ass chick,
so take a sec, just chill and get off my tip
i'm just tryna get rich of these tracks i get
and you tryna get rich off the scratch i get
and you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, its...

"never too late, too late to start start"

i'm tryna have the city on lockdown
fam off the block now
money coming fast, more cash then the cops now
would harass, but they can't really not now
used to laugh, but your man's really hot now
i used to rap for the kids in class
told 'em i would use rap just to get my cash
and i was on the word about how to get my math
and told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass
'cause i can't find a interest in my book
so i stayed to myself and every class i took
supposed to be doing work, but i made my hooks
'cause i get motivation everywhere i look
and i show no regret for any chance i took
but i learn from mistakes just like i should
so if you dudes ain't paid your dues, for you fools its...

"never too late, too late too start start, never too late, too late to start start"


with the hunger of a chris wallace back in '94
i like to welcome y'all to rock with pg's young ball
from the bottom of the pot, yea i'm the pitts of the burgh
with the kids on the curb, and small time, is pitching the herb
i'm back, and those who didn't previously know what i'm crack
to the people, i'm legalized the lethal
we all got problems involving the rude of evil
but they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup!
and for the record, i ain't no half stepper
i rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real

cats chasing their paper, that's basic
mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it
as i look back at hard it seems
i remember when this music thing was all but a dream
but i'm here for my city
i'm 'bout to make history

'fore i swallow a tear

'cause i be going hard
stevie on his job
i'm praying to something to happen?

i try so hard
to survive

40 long nose, scott pippen

count money, breakin down, we're the same motion
shark in the tank, a small fish in the ocean

collect calls from the pimps, talking through receivers
why body blowin', cali rollin' through medina
'bout a hundred racks soakin in the joint cleaner
3 quarter chinchilla for the winter season
collect calls from the pimps talking through the glass
'cause i ran up in yo crib talkin' through a mass

ferrari dirt bikes on the turn pipe
keep my pits clean so i never get kept
with parole, kiss me, it's too much to miss
out here in the fast lane
i wait till champagne

while i'm strapped up two-stepping with the devil dancing
diluted with blood in my eyes

i got my gun on me, i tell my kids i'll never leave them lonely

since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
sleeping with that lethal weapon, playing danny glover
ak40, own a hundred if we're talking numbers
load up the clip, shoot up your mama

from the depths of the sea, back to the block

a life for a life, a body for a price
i want to smell his last breath took
and look him in the eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
because i'm him, it's in the air, i can feel it
shot him four times with the gun i was concealing
overkilling, it ain't no coming back from it
then walked away with a demeanour like i just done it
something evil this way's coming

i got my gun on me, i tell my kids i'll never leave them lonely

all i do is smoke loud
i be rolling all day, mix it in the champagne
and these bottles all free, not a single drink paid
because they want me, they want me in their club
but if you got the numbers i'll be glad to show you love
every time they play my song i'mma fill another cup
'cause i'm down for whatever i can always keep it up

suicide orlandos and two or ten hoes.

feel like i was born for balling out
move it up and just for falling out.

i'm flying around and i'm getting it,

write your promise down in that anthem.
i'm creepin' on a 'billy,
keep my watch a hand game
like it's a lot of champagne,
you're flying jets, i can but jets
and i ain't speaking about no damn plane.
it's passion and plain fashion
matching my things, catching
action from things, making,
flashing my rings, captain.
twin vs and tires, envy my entire,
caught a lot don't have the heart
cause real kings build empires.
i did everything that i claim, you ain't like us, we're reborn.

girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up
and you was thinkin' "damn boy, grow up!"

i hope it's not too late for me
could you just wait for me a while
is it too late, too late?

i hope it's not too late
i got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
ridin' in a chevy that should've been a mercedez
tryna keep my head above water
so i stayed out the navy
i, i, i made a promise to my girl
said imma leave town and bring back the whole world
so i bought a ticket

i barely gotta text the call back
you're a dog
out here chasin paper

now you got a roommate
my homie served ten years
it's too late for him to be treated equally
too late for him to make it out the hood legally
ridin' around doing my thing
is it too late to be tryin' to live dreams
turn them up real
reality is just a technicality
and so is being fake
so don't tell me that
i'm that i'm toooo late

i hope it's not too late for me
could you just wait for me a while
is it too late, too late?

so they said i took too long

and don't look too strong

not an ultimatum
just an option in this world
but things come and go
when the clocks never stop
be on time for nothing
a little late for a lot

i hope it's not too late for me
could you just wait for me a while
is it too late, too late?

i hope it's not too late
i hope it's not too late
the last thing i wanna hear is too late

and this was all inspired by a little marvin gaye and chardonnay


yo! it's money time!
yezzir...

i'm tryna stuff 'em until i can't fit no more
i'm talking donald trump level
i'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
all aboard for the shuttle
all the hoes, screaming "ho!"

if i come with half, bet i leave with the rest
ok, you might be cool getting 50%
i'm like "what you doing? i need diddy's percent!"
got a million on line 1 and
another mil' dialing in, momma on line 4
telling me how much not to spend
'ye on line 3 telling me how we about to win
you on hold tryna get conferenced in
i just gotta have it, trying to imagine
making it happen, i prayed about it and grabbed it
get casted, i'm in a race with myself to see
who could get it the fastest
the warmer the weather, the colder the drink
the colder the weather, the warmer the mink
with no ink - i get it

i'm tryna stuff 'em until i can't fit no more
i'm talking donald trump level
i'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
all the hoes! screaming "ho!"

whoa! the sky never seemed so low
looking at her like "you never seemed so close"
i had a dream about a trillion in cash
it's time to make it happen!
i'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
talking cash, you ain't got to fake an accent
i've broke enough tree down that i couldmake a cabin
all my ones that i have is then divided by half
pass it on to my man, write my will out then
pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
i had a dream i was greatest of all time
greatest of all big's, greatest of all sean's
the warmer the weather, the colder the drink
the colder the weather, the warmer the mink
with no ink - i get it



sometimes i dream bigger than i live
sometimes i think better when i'm lit
so goin' and light it
roll it up, ignite it
i swear i've been through everything in life but a coffin
and my middle name michael ho
success is my idol and being broke is my rival
but it's cool because i got the title ho
see i just want my fantasies in real life
you got everything tell me what it feel like
they give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
is you feeling me?
if not you feel my energy
see i know i'm a make it, but even if i don't
don't feel bad cause honestly all the times that i had
those will be the best memories

be the best memories
i hope that you remember me
these will be the best memories
cause in the end all you really have is memories

let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
reflect on everything we missed
cause you know we'll never get it back

are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
everywhere i go i get a group of hugs
that's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
how many trends you gotta set till you considered great
how many missed calls till you considered fake
how many dreams till it's considered fate
i'm eating in a world where i'm considered bait
a workaholic addicted to bills
people addicted to me 'cause they addicted to real
my best friend got addicted to pills
i ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"
i'm praying that he make, wishing we could go back
cause honestly all the times that we had
those be the best memories...

let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
reflect on everything we missed
cause you know we'll never get it back

sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
was mailed one when i heard nique had died in that crash
seemed like yesterday i just seen him smile and laugh
when i should be happy i can
they say my music beating, 'cause i follow my heart
i always have faith, like who swallows the darts
and with my mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase
houses bigger than a palace
but she a queen, so she deserve it
so i'm focused, they try to throw me off track
but they just hurdles
i'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
man, i'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
fast forward a few years later
remember the first time i was rhyming for kan'
almost as nervous as the first time i rhymed for my mom
sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
but i already dreamed it
so it felt like i rehearsed it
much as my grandma took care of me since i was birthed
sad i used to steal twenty dollar bills right out her purses
no i ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
life out of a hearse
and if i die, of course i have the memories...

let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
reflect on everything we missed
cause you know we'll never get it back

hook - the dream]
how can you blame us?
i wanna break you off like right now

that's the reason i said "hi" right now
come have the time of your life right now
all you gotta do is close your eyes right now
please, the saks fifth, first class
only culture games and practice
and i feel like the right time
twisting up my fingers
like the young p-a-c, b-i-g but she just call me d-a-d
i do it

how can you blame us?
i wanna break you off like right now

and i'mma need that penthouse on top of the world
that detroit player on top of the world
detroit players on top of your girl
what a beautiful life...
fancy things...
what a beautiful life...
that's why we should get gone right now
i'm trying to get you home right now
i bet i could turn you on right now
really i can't call it
stress turned me into a weed-head
and parties into an alcoholic
and money turned me into a workaholic
and money turned her into a twerkaholic
yeah do it, do it, do it with no hands
do it like you do it when you do it with your man
start it up, guaranteed i'mma finish
so here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
my jewelry is ice-cold, stone is albino
'cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno
let's give 'em a light show

i ain't paul mccartney or john lenon
i ain't buying beetles, i'm buying benzes
they mad at you mamacita
how can you blame us?
i wanna break you off like right now


feeling like i got the cheat code to life
jewelry looking like it got free throwed in ice
debatin' with the reaper not to repo my life
cause in my 23 years i done lived a couple lives
like why? 'cause i stunt, bags of trees, like its fall
the girls that was outta my league tryna play with my balls
i pay bills, i work hard
and when my momma cried a river, they never gave us a bridge
ridin' low, puffin on lye
i came way too far to f-ck it up now
text from my mom said "me and your grandma proud"
i'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
i'd rather die with a smile instead
i'm just multiplying the money and dividing the legs
b-i


but i'm never dividing the bread

throwin' westside up like pac, when they pop ya block up,
big poppa flock off, you holy lil ? holy kenobi, chewbacca
i'm balenciaga, chanel, hermes but i betchu that you won't find it
rocking louie and mc'ing
obama suite, you one below, up in the joe biden
i'm in your city just chillin', where are your hoes hiding?
24k for the fit because it's 24 carats
and i can't lie, the price'll probably go up when i wear it
i'm just d-town reppin'
regret it like half the hoes i smashed in the sheets
at least i realise now how much i loved ashlee marie
and when it's all said and done i'd probably give her my knee
'cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
man she almost cried when she seen me on tv on bet
just making it seem easy
standing next to common sense and yeezy
and the whole world's seen me


"man, i wake up to a wet dream
every week is fashion week and every day i'm pressed clean
detroit's angel, i even got red wings
i'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
they having a kissing fight and i'm don king
everybody know i'm coming soon like lebron's ring"

you tell me that wasn't verse of the year
swear to god i'm overlaid, all my girls get overf-cked
all my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed
so take that check out and owe it up
man i turned impossible possible
the same teacher who told me rappin' is what not to do
said i'm throwin' my life away if i drop outta school
want me to come speak to the kids, the point i gotta prove
is that i did everything they told me not to do
after i went down the road, they told me not to cruise
they ain't know that was my road to success
now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
my old school look like a t-rex, i should feed her fossil fuels
man, i turn my enemies to molecules
little hoes
without any preparation, i exceed these expectations
man, they wanna see me dead, but i gave them dedication
i'm yellin' f-ck 'em all, with a hundred exclamations
'cause i'mma be the man till my f-cking expiration

b-i-g, i do it
this goes out to my muthaf-cking city
detroit, westside to be exact
right over there on northline...


understand that what goes around comes around

and i don't ever wanna come down
baby, tell me it's time to go
tell me i gotta leave, then tell me i gotta stay
tell me i'm all you need

understand that what goes around comes around

and i don't ever wanna come down
so, baby, tell me who the best
tell me it's not me
tell me i gotta go, then tell me i'm all you need

understand, i am
the renowned, newest talk of the town
when errybody talk and just keeps on talkin' about
wassup? tellin' girls "you should call if you down"
and if my phone doesn't ring, then leave it after the pound
'cause i be up in the air, more than i do on the ground
you're now rockin' wit' somebody on they f-ckin' bidness
love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
'cause when it turns real, that's when everybody turns fake
instead of sayin' f-ck all 'a y'all and turning away
man, i was cool enough to say "f-ck it" and let 'em stay
f-ck, i hate to say i told you so
so buying rounds is my way of saying "told you, ho"

understand that what goes around comes around

and i don't ever wanna come down
baby, tell me it's time to go
tell me i gotta leave, then tell me i gotta stay
tell me i'm all you need

understand that what goes around comes around

and i don't ever wanna come down
so, baby, tell me who the best
tell me it's not me
tell me i gotta go, then tell me i'm all you need

now, i can't tell what's a better accessory
my new watch, or the chick that's standin' right next to me

double shots, then re-reload
let's toast to the interns that made it to ceo
boss player, collectin' every single check that's owed out
puttin' on a show until everything is sold out
man, i'm chillin' wit' jays, 'ye's, and common senses
it's crazy when legends are peers and your competition
you know, went to school with jay, and was almost jigga
or hooped against lebron and would almost get 'i'm
would hate to look back on my life and say "i almost did it"
f-ck that, reflectin' on the last chain i bought
they on my tracks, waitin' on the next train of thought
visualizin' how the crown might be
got the whole rap game tryna sound like me

understand that what goes around comes around

and i don't ever wanna come down
baby, tell me it's time to go
tell me i gotta leave, then tell me i gotta stay
tell me i'm all you need

understand that what goes around comes around

and i don't ever wanna come down
so, baby, tell me who the best
tell me it's not me
tell me i gotta go, then tell me i'm all you need

this dedicated to my ex girls, both of 'em
and then when i see y'all, y'all act like "awww, i'm so happy for you"

understand that what goes around comes around
and i don't ever wanna come down
baby, tell me it's time to go

understand that what goes around comes around
and i don't ever wanna come down
so, baby, tell me who the best

i'm tipping strippers but i call it penny pinchin'
my new crib got it's own city limit
blue marble on the floor
wet as salt water

just a bittersweet symphony

i'm from a big city
tryna make a living
come to my hood
everybody get it
and for that paper all the wrong things sound right
where i'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
where i'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
just a bittersweet symphony

one hundred keys
one hundred please
my gazuntite could make a whole city sneeze
walk the mud jungle where they grind it out the leaves
so they swarm to my honeycomb, hideout for the bees
you know what this sounds like
money counter sound bytes
machine gun fire
name ringin' through like the town like
church bells ringin'

know what he was found like?
colombian necktie over hospital gown white
she live on her knees
i live in a condo in the trees
the air's a little thinner that i breathe
iron man audi, let the top strip tease
my life is slow motion but the watch screaming freeze
the feds dragged neck, couldn't take nothin' from me
the decoy car is a crash test dummy
what follows is a hundred of 'em wrapped like a mummy

i'm from a big city
tryna make a living
come to my hood
everybody get it
and for that paper all the wrong things sound right
where i'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
where i'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
just a bittersweet symphony

boi
and they gon' risk a hundred lives
so they could rock a hundred whites
the guests look like a hundred lights
yeah i got a main girl, but i done hit a hundred types
every wrong i do, i'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
got it for cheap, compare the price
and don't worry 'bout the info
from where they ride pintos, and could afford enzo's
but bricks open windows
countin' a hundred hundreds, more by more
built this from the tile up, floor by floor

i'm from a big city
tryna make a living
come to my hood
everybody get it
and for that paper all the wrong things sound right
where i'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
where i'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
just a bittersweet symphony

i know the program director hot
but i spit a freestyle up in there so cold
and i heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
and that's around the time that i got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
manager said we ain't got time, but time to time

tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
in something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
what you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
what you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
but when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on e
all the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
all the faith that i have, just ain't all the faith that i need
i'm sorry

i know you're not my child talking like that. focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. and the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. you've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha

coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
good girls stopped being good when i turned 'em into hoes
annotate dreams stopped being dreams when i turned 'em into goals
big was the first one that had it
then i saw nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
then i saw kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
then ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
used to pick me up from school right after work
now she rolling up in that caddy like she coming to church
she's ask why i rock all this gold, 'cause i'm coming in first
got the streets behind me like i was staring in the rear-view
used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
now i'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do
looking in the mirror and i'm still you, i'm still you

got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain

big was the first one that had it
now jacob the jeweler benefit from my habits
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain

what's the noise all about with this rap stuff
i can say i never been punked, robbed or smacked up
i can say i never been chased, jumped or backed up
'cause it's a mental game, i learned that when i got my first initial chain
i didn't fake it, it was gold plated, i was posing relatin'
to those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
that bonus, that culture, those projects
they got in my bones, now i'm coppin' stones
sorry sierra leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long
my pendant offensive, in the truest form
platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain

big was the first one that had it
then i saw nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
and i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain

on a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls i paid
i done gave my city drive all the roads i paved
no matter what way i turn things go my way
i'm rocking chains everyday, so you know i slave
look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
no heroes where i'm from, bullets only thing flying
i know the higher that i go, the harder to climb
but after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
police only work 12-hour shifts
trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
ff, good, you know i'm reppin' crew on crews
stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
girls on girls, lingerie and moulin rouge
god damn, i think i'm gon' o.d.
off this asparagus and bread and pasta
need a doctor, i've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
it's like i got a built-in doppler
i don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
but remember my first ass and the first time she came
it almost felt as good as when i got my first chain

got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain

jay-z taught me money ain't a thing
came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
stunting, stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting, stunting like i got my first chain

it's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
i got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
about two months in a week's time
went from feelin' hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
see this piece that i own now, how sick is the rope?
taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick
who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
things switch up, people trip up
the money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
the most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
saying that you love me, i surely hope and if you don't
it might be too late, but the songs will live on
just know this fact, you were all wrong
now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
more like a prance - i'm signing off with a crotch grab

thank you man for letting me get on this record, sean
you the coolest
understand? yum.

them boys round the corner wanna sell in that cal ripken
yeah i got a magnificent hustle, cause' imma' grinder

no yoga boy i was making blow stretch
press the fast forward button, i'm pushing a foreign something
all through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
it's time for a new crib, it's time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie that's just loose change
getting money four ways so i can buy a two-door
stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though

and i'll be goddamned if i didn't
put the city on let's get it
let's get it

detroit, once the backbone of this country
now it's the largest u.s. city to file for bankruptcy
thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
going from a population of nearly 2 million
to under 700,000 in a matter of years
the people of detroit really going to have to stick together,
to make it through these tough times


stay close to me, so close to me
that's how it's supposed to be
long as you've been knowing me
you been holding me down,
i watch over you, you watch over me
and that's how it's supposed to be
and we are, all right

cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
the lights go off

just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be

"might not make it this time"
is what not to say at this time
sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
and you tell them they all right, when they need a cure
i'mma believe in paradise if i don't see the sand
only palm trees i got is this weed off in my hand
around the same time my mom said "sean, you need a plan
mrs. freeman's son, across the street got shot,
now she need a hand!"
traumatized, gotta watch, his momma cry
now i gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, tell his momma lies
like, "it's gonna be all right," knowing it ain't all right
i know there's just so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
the lights go off
say it's going to be, all right
it's going to be, all right
cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
the lights go off
say it's going to be, all right
it's going to be, all right

you know i love you momma like she mine,
whether we together, or we trying
we climb, i left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
the cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
it came from the breast, just spread to the spine
"this can't be my mom!"
got me thinking, "what's a girl to do, a girl to do?
when her world's a pool?
and she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
and all the stress is all propane
she's burned again"
hoping i could make her smile
take cancer and david blaine it out,
poof! disappear, god make an out!

now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
the lights go off
say it's going to be, all right
it's going to be, all right
cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
the lights go off
say it's going to be, all right
it's going to be, all right

stay close to me, so close to me
that's how it's supposed to be
long as you've been knowing me
you been holding me down,
i watch over you, you watch over me
and that's how it's supposed to be
and we are, all right
and we are, all right
and we are, all right

with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

i'm a still watch my bros

trapped in the middle of the map, with a little bitty rock
and a little bit of rap
and like literally jack

i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

they merking kids, they murder kids here
why you think they don't talk about it? they deserted us here
somebody get katie couric in here
probably scared of all the refugees

they be shooting whether it's dark or not
i mean the days is pretty dark a lot
down here it's easier to find a gun

no love for the opposition
specifically a cop position
cause they've never been in our position
getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching

i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

i know you scared

i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared, too
if you was there
then we just knew you'd care, too

it just got warm out
i hope that it storm in the morning
i hope that it's pouring out

i hate crowded beaches
i hate the sound of fireworks
and i ponder what's worse
between knowing it's over and dying first

'cause everybody dies in the summer
wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
i heard everybody's dying in the summer
so pray to god for a little more spring

i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared, too
if you was there
then we just knew you'd care, too

miss mary mattress, geriatrics
i wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
she said, "pill pop, baby girl 'cause i promise you, you tweaked
the empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek," the masochism that you preach
practice back flips, tragic actress on a movie with no screen
when the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

studious gluteus maxim models is sending him

but they saw it fit that i talk right
with my drawers hid but my hard head
stayed in the clouds like a lost kite

but gravity had me up in a submission hold
like i'm dancing with the devil with two left feet and i'm pigeon toed
in two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
and two missing toes
but it's love like cupid kissing a mistletoe

nice to see you father new year
middle finger uncle samuel
shooting death with weighted dice
and hitting stains on birthday candles
i know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'cause they help me beat my demons ass

like cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
the type to love from a distance not the type that told her
spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
with babies on the block under arms like fighting odors

coppers and quotas
hold ya head like 2pac had taught
obviously they are on a come up

concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones

what's better than tripping is falling in love
what's better than letterman, leno, fallon and all the above
what's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club

what's better than paper is balling it up
what's better than followers is actually falling in love
what's better than frolicking, follies, fallin in mud
rolling in green pastures, wandering following love

what's better than eating is feeding your fam
what's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
what's better than leaning and needing your xan
is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land

what's better than yelling is hollering love
what's better than rhymes, nickles, dimes and dollars and dubs
is dialing up your darling just for calling her up
there ain't nothing better than falling in love

i've seen it come back, back, back and forth
you hit the nail right on top of the head
i know you seen it all before
but when it looks you in the eyes
it ain't nothing you could say, but that's love

that's love
that's love
that's love
say that's love
that's love
that's love, that's love, that's love

i love you, i love you

kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
the richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace

wore my feelings on my sleeveless
my weed seedless, my trees leafless
i miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
and back when mike jackson was still jesus

before i believed in not believing in
yeah, i inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
my big homie died young, just turned older than him

i seen it happen, i seen it happen, i see it always
he still be screaming, i see his demons in empty hallways
i trip to make the fall shorter
fall quarter was just a tall order

and i'm hungry, i'm just not that thirsty
as of late, my verses seem not so verse-y
and all my words just mean controversy
took the team up off my back like "that's not your jersey?"

stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping i don't get picked
all this medicine in me hoping i don't get sick
making all this money, hoping i don't get rich

sometimes the truth don't rhyme
sometime the lies get millions of views
funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
from your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view

i think love is beautiful, too
building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
for future hoopers dead from rugers shooting through the empty alley
could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school

damn that acid burn when it clean ya
i still miss being a senior
and performing at all those open mic events
high schools, eyes closed seeing arenas

and i still get jealous of vic
and vic still jealous of me
but if you touch my brother
and the rest of your team

smoking cigarettes to look cooler
i only stop by to look through ya
and i'm only getting greedier
and i'm still mr. youmedia

and i still can't find talent
mom still thinks i should go back to school
and justin still think i'm good enough

and mama jan still don't take her meds
and i still be asking god to show his face
and i still be asking god to show his face

i am a new man, i am sanctified
oh i am holy, i have been baptized
i have been born again, i am the white light
rain, rain don't go away


uh, it definitely be mad important
ay man, that sound like a prince song

still a chain smoking, name dropping
mother, shut your mouth

still a chain smoking, name dropping
mother, shut your mouth
brain broken, frank ocean listening
stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
paint dripping, mother shut your mouth

somebody pray for the god, oh lord, i wonder what michael's on
shoulda died yelling, "yolo was a lie and you a liar, wonder why you wanna die so young"
you and i look just alike and i'm afraid that this one right here might be last time that i write a song
so i ain't tryna go out at all got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
last chance joint gotta be a dance joint from an introspective drugged out standpoint
throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint, old school for my own old man joint

still a chain smoking, name dropping
mother, shut your mouth
brain broken, frank ocean listening
stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
paint dripping, mother shut your mouth

i play this so loud in the car, i forget to park my whip

like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
i'm at war with my wrongs, i'm writing four different songs
i never forged it or forfeited, i'm a force to be reconciled
they want four minute songs
you need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
i'm feeling shortness of breath, so nico grab you a horn
hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!

there are obstacles in life
many many trials and tribulations that come up
but you got to realize and know
that even jericho walls must fall
every wall must fall
fall jericho, fall

i'm gon' praise him, praise him till i'm gone

the type of worship make jesus come back a day early
with the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
here, for i will speak noble things as they trusted me
only righteous, i might just shrug at the skullduggery
i couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
exalt, exalt, glorify
descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
i used to hide from god
ducked down in the slums like "shhh"

i was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa
no hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
i prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
or so it seemed
a mustard seed was all i needed to sow a dream
i build the ark, gently, gently, i rowed my boat down noah's stream
sometimes the path i took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
i was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
but she was always there when i needed to phone a friend or use a life line
from a lofty height, wage won
the poltergeist to exalt the christ
spark the dark with the pulse of light
strike a corpse with a pulse of life
i spit on the tidal of tidal waves
i spit on the apple and kill a worm
a fire in cali will swallow a valley for every african village burned
jay elect would've never made it
'o son of man, o' son of man

cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
poison the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
it was all a lie

satan's establishment crumbling down

bury my enemies under the ground

hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
we in a marathon we could build a marriage on
arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
i've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
labels told me to my face that they own my friends
i got to pray i got to pray, like hammer after "2 legit"
i got the power i could poke lucifer with crucifix
i "stand up" like i'm ludacris
i know some folks that talk so much you'd think they drive an uber whip
damn, queen said why we in a queen bed
i said it's yours don't worry little bean head

you made a church out of feathers
so when she fly to the father
she know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
she gave my name away to your holy house
she like my blessings in disguise
she like her jesus mountain high
so he can watch her lonely child
i know my god
i know my god seen his breaks and his edges
are jagged for giving that pain to his city in gold
like everything is everything
like all them days he prayed with me
like emptiness was tamed in me
and all that was left was his love
and all that was left was his love
and all that was left was his love

i speak of promise land
soil as soft as momma's hands
running water, standing still
endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
rice under black beans
walked into apple with cracked screens
and told prophetic stories of freedom
found warmth in a black queen for when i get cold
like nat king, i'm doing the dad thing
i speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
make you remember how to smile good
i'm pre-currency post-language, anti-label
pro-famous, i'm broadway joe namath
kanye's best prodigy
he ain't signed me but he proud of me
i got some ideas that you gotta see
make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey
they never seen a rapper practice modesty
i never practice, i only perform
i don't even warn, i don't eat it warm, i won't be reborn
i speak to god in public, i speak to god in public
he keep my rhymes in couplets
i used to dance to michael, i used to dance in high school
i used to pass out music, i still pass out music
the people's champ must be everything the people can't be
i'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some hebru brantleys
you must've missed the come up, i must be all i can be
call me mister mufasa, i had to master stampedes

i made it through, made it through, made it through
and everything i gave to you, i gave to you, i gave to you
you got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming, coming, coming
so are you ready?

when we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
every moment was so precious, then
i'm still kicking it, i'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
the entire earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
i should say and you should hear i've loved
i've loved the good times here, i've loved our good times here

say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
we are all mortals, aren't we? any moment this could go
cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
but you should know, you should hear, that i have loved
i have loved the good times here, and i will miss our good times here

spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
and millions are left behind while the sky burns
there wasn't room for you and i, only you, goodbye, goodbye

now the sky, could be blue, i don't mind
without you it's a waste of time
could be blue, i don't mind
without you it's a waste of time

the sky could be blue, could be grey
without you i'm just miles away
the sky could be blue, i don't mind
without you it's a waste of time


i think i started somethin', i got what i wanted
did didn't i can't feel nothin', superhuman
zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion
i blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile
stripper booty and a rack like wow, brain like berkeley
met her at coachella, i went to see jigga, she went to see z trip, perfect
i took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
she said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
for tuition doin' porn in the valley, at least you workin'
but girl i can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway
she said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of

novocaine, baby, baby, novocaine, baby, i want you
love me now, when i'm gone, love me none
love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', i'm feelin' like
been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
i blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile
stripper booty with the rack like wow, i'll never forget ya
you put me on a feelin' i never had, never had, never had
and ever since i've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
now i'm somethin' like the chemist on campus
but there's no drug around, quite like what i found in you
i still can't feel my face, what am i smokin' anyway
she said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of

novocaine, baby, baby, novocaine, baby, i want you
love me now, when i'm gone, love me none
love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

novocaine for the pain

pretty girls involved with me
makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
all the pretty girls involved with me
makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity

i can't feel a thing
i can't feel her
novocaine for the pain


i believe jehovah jireh
i believe there's heaven, i believe in war
i believe a woman's temple
gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
i believe that marriage isn't
between a man and woman but between love and love
and i believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
but you must believe in something, something, something
you gotta believe in something, something, something

i still believe in man
a wise one asked me why
'cause i just don't believe we're wicked
i know that we sin but i do believe we try
we all try, the girls try, the boys try
women try, men try, you and i try, try, we all try

i don't believe in time travel
i don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
i don't believe our lives are simple
and i don't believe they're short, this is interlude
i don't believe my hands are cleanly
can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
she didn't believe me when i said that i lost my faith
you must believe in something, something, something
you gotta believe in something, something, something

i still believe in man
a wise one asked me why
'cause i just don't believe we're wicked
i know that we sin but i do believe we try
we all try, the girls try, the boys try
women try, men try, you and i try, try, we all try


- stop! let me go! you don't got no jodeci?
- what's a radiohead... anyway
- whatever...


when i was younger i used to wonder like

if i was singing songs, just to sing the songs
i couldn't play guitar like van halen
had no secret chords like saint david
but you still came around, ate your lunch with me
used to park your car to try to bus with me
but i would say girl don't be dumb, i'm riding shotgun
we could kick it in the living room looking through my whole vinyl collection
and you could teach me how to slow dance or something
and i'mma give you chills harmonizing to otis, isley, marvin

and every time somebody asked me
if i sing songs to get at women, i say yeah
they say no fair no fair that's cheating
if i sing songs to get at women, i say yeah
they say no fair, no fair that's cheating
i say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
you'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah

now i'm in the lab, always working late
always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
she used to stop by, come and holla at me
put her purse down and try to battle rap me
don't even listen to the songs i record
but she be banging that drake in my car
i'm so far gone, she stay blasting trey and his songs

now every time somebody asks me
if i sing songs to get at women
i say naw they say okay i don't believe it
i say nope i swear i never do it
if i sing songs to get at women, i say naw
they say who do you think you're kidding
i know you, you stole my girlfriend
now see i just don't play fair, but it's fair enough
cause yo girl broke my heart in half
now i'm singing 'bout heartbreak
and now i'm singing 'bout love lost


talk to me and i better not hear a word
do me baby, i better not feel it girl
baby, i still got one bullet left in my nine
finna do a lovecrime, lovecrime, finna do a lovecrime

murder, murder, murder she wrote
lovecrimes, lovecrimes

you write me love letters with your father's pen
if he knew the freaky, freaky things that you write with it
is it really wrong that i want to be the baby daddy?
is that a lovecrime, lovecrime? tell me it's a lovecrime

murder, murder, murder she wrote
lovecrimes, lovecrimes

in the getaway car
you know i love it when the ride is smooth
if we ever get caught
it'd be a long vacation for two

murder, murder, murder she wrote
lovecrimes, lovecrimes

there will be tears, i've no doubt

and when those tears have run out
you will be numb and blue

and they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad
you can't miss what you ain't had, well i can, i'm sad and

there will be tears, i've no doubt
there may be smiles but a few
and when those tears have run out
you will be numb and blue

big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
now i'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
and every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
they never see them
and i've got this black suit on
roaming around like i'm ready for a funeral

who's that talking in the library?
who's that talking in my library?
is that you? no, i won't put you out
'cause what would this place be without my muse?
nothing special
every book in here i wrote
some i'm not too proud of, some i wish i could burn
so many pages i wrote, wish i could revise them
but there's no erasing and the best advice i got
was keep writing, yeah, and keep living, yeah
and keep loving, oh, loving, loving, loving

and when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
so will we turn to dust, so will we, dust, dust

who's that laughing in my library?

ah
american love, american me
american you, american tear
american heartbreak
oh oh oh

i took a walk with the palm trees, as the daylight fell
sangria in the canteen, talkin' to myself
this tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
my pretty woman in a ball gown, i'm richard gere in a tux
gettin' married in the courthouse, writing vows in a rush
makin' out before the judge, with my teenage wife
got a wedding band done, that i just might die with

it's an american wedding
they don't mean too much but we were so in love
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours, that's american law

m-r-s dot kennedy, she signed her name in pen
in a fancy fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
a thesis on islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-american girls
after school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
this is the home of the brave, land of the free
but your, parents still didn't know
she said, "i've had a hell of a summer, so baby, don't take this hard
but maybe we should get an annulment before this goes way too far"

it's just an american wedding
they don't mean too much, they don't last enough
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours, american divorce

well you can have my mustang, that's all i've got in my name
but jesus christ don't break my heart, this wedding ring won't ever wipe off
you'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the usa

don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
we been some hustlers since it began dude
they so vain i tell 'em this ain't you
that she can't do, that he can't do
that you can't do, that we can't do
that she can't do, that he can't do
that you can't do, that we can't do
that she can't do, that he can't do
that you can't do


breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
just hop on my back, i'll take you down the stairs
into my backyard and lay you on the grass

give it you over again, over again over again
over again over again, over again over again
making love, underneath the cherry leaves
baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
baby girl, i'll give it to you naturally, naturally

feeling like adam when he first found out this existed
me and my eve trying out our first positions
and it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me
playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you

give it you over again, over again over again
over again over again, over again over again
making love, underneath the cherry leaves
baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
baby girl, i'll give it to you naturally, naturally

let's see, i have, ooh yeah, i'mma make myself a hot link when i get home

oh, oh, oh, oh, there's a thief out on the move
oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
oh, oh, oh, oh, they have taken cleopatra, cleopatra


and we'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
in a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
as we march to rhythm on the palace floor
chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

oh, oh, oh, oh, set the cheetahs on the loose
aye, aye, aye, there's a thief out on the move
oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
aye, aye, they have taken cleopatra, cleopatra

the jewel of africa, jewel
what good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
how could you run off on me? how could you run off on us?
you feel like god inside that gold
i found you laying down with samson and his full head of hair
found my black queen cleopatra, bad dreams, cleopatra

oh, oh, remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
oh, oh, our war is over, our queen has met her doom
oh, no more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
oh, no more, it has killed cleopatra, cleopatra

big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
wake up to your girl, for now let's call her cleopatra, cleopatra
i watch you fix your hair then put your panties on in the mirror, cleopatra
then your lipstick, cleopatra, then your six inch heels, catch her


pimpin' in my convos
bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
floor model tv with the vcr
got rubies in my damn chain
whip ain't go no gas tank but it still got wood grain
got your girl working for me
hit the strip and my bills paid that keep my bills paid

working at the pyramid

do what you have to
i do what i had to
to break through a pick a style that sticks like glue
and as i rank i wanna thank no one
you helped me around
my parents put me down
i never skipped town
i stood my ground
we kept showin up
drinkin' and throwin' up
rap was my life
as i was growin' up
actin' a fool in school no one topped us
smart ass in class at times abnoxious
drivin' a bronco
runnin' my own show
and pullin the look a like marilyn monroe hoes
and me and bo got together
made sense
i scratched records and performed a few tricks
pumpin the new sounds town to town
who holds it down like bad leroy brown
now i won't stop cause yo i'm kid rock
the genuine article

they don't want me

f-f-fames a costin the price ain't nice
it's like the roll of the dice
for a whole new life
but don't get my song wrong
i enjoy it alot
walkin' around like a big shot
'cause i'm kid rock
smooth as an ice cube
cool as an igloo
and more complex, than a rubix cube
a healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue
smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run
and as i incline through time to get mine
i try not to slide, but walk a straight line
though it's hard when the climb gets steep
the one who finds is the one who seeks
so i sought and fought
and alot i got taught
and although i left those who stole got caught
many shows i rocked
many suckers i laughed at
and those who snapped back usually got slapped
the cat if i was strap
'cause i was a sun of a gun
livin' life on the run
now i pleaded 18 and outdone by none
bold, young, handsome, bad like bronson
pumpin the new sounds town to town
and when in motown i cool out in greektown
on the upside with nothin' too high
the genuine article

they don't want me
chuck nice break that beat down
uh huh... uh huh... uh huh
kdc... huh

six generations of rap and i'm first
ready to burst, the style is rehearsed
i worked and worked and worked and i worked
when many thought i was just gettin' jerked
used, abused, but i paid my dues
and now no one out there could fill my shoes
and my pants and do this dance
it went slow not quick, but now i'm your pick
ain't that a trip when i started from zip
and now up and up and up i won't stop
the flop just pop the flat top the kid rock
yes me the low key mc
with the ability to rock a party
anywhere and make people stare
i'm lookin' while i'm cookin with no care
pumpin the new sound town to town
who holds it down like bad leroy brown
and still i won't stop growin' this flat top
the genuine article

they don't want me


everything i do gonna be funny

new player on the field so yield and get back
to the wall
'cause i'm playin' ya all
like a game
k-i-d is the name
some complain
and they got a little fame
and it's a shame
for what its worth
i'm down with earth
pourin it on like ms. butterworth
rich and thick
kinda quick not slow
the rhymes i fit into flow
all in a row, from the intro
to the end so, ho
put down the microphone and go
step a side as i make room to bloom
any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb
as soon as i grip the mic to get loose
don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice
meanwhile i kick a rhyme from the pile


get down on your knees and pray when i break you
down with a sound
comin' down with a pound
or a bang
if you can't hang with the slang
that i exploit
comin' straight from detroit
rough without a doubt or a question
kid rock here in the flesh
and addressin and defining certain issues
so wipe the tears from your eyes
you can't hide so don't be surprised
when i dismiss you from your throne
and send you home
as a kid rock clone
'cause i can hold my own
like ya hold a milkbone
simple as this with a grip that won't quit
so when i hit the skit
that's it
so don't come in face with the base
and remember your just an imitation
don't get buckwhile
in fact don't smile
'cause i'll pull your file

i'll claim the boundries of my domain
detroit... detroit
fresh, i'm from the midwest
from motown... from motown

i'm like steel or concrete yo 'cause i'm the hardest
down with a label known to be the largest
not bein modest don't even think of tryin' to hang
cause yo kid rock rolls like a stop o
i roll thick
i roll heavy
d-nice justs keeps the pace steady
so get ready to feel the pain
i'm kid rock drivin' girls insane
so listen rappers and get to the program
breakin ya down is the kid rock slogan
and any rapper who thinks about dissin
you know what i'll say?
i got a great big dick
so anyone who can't adjust
gets rust
and then bites the dust
be ready to walk a mile
'cause i'll smack that kool-aid smile


burnin

don't you?


see a fly skinny on the avenue
my shades down hat flipped on and on a cashew
could not believe my eyes so i lifted up my shades
and this girl is starring at me as if she wanted to get laid
next the girl started steppin and she crossed the street
she walked to me and at that my knees got weak
then i snapped to realize that it was my duty
to get this freak and co-wax the booty

wax that booty
co-wax the booty
freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty
wax that booty
co-wax the booty
i gotta freak freak so i am gonna wax her booty

heading for the crib i was reciting some rhymes
when the freak cut in and started telling of the times
she wanted to rock me and these were no lies
and that is when i contracted the rise in my levis
step into my crib she said the rise impressed her
so without delay i began to undress her
unstrapped her bra and whispered to her are you with me
she said yes so i grabbed them titties
next was the test to see if she was high rank
i dropped her panties and was slippin, i asked do you stank
she said no and noted to me that her shower soap is gucci
so i dropped my boxers and headed for her coochie
headed fo her coochie
grease it down real good
headed for her coochie
dang that's good

now when i got to her coochie i looked close to see
if this girl had any types of signs of vd
she did not so i said to myself oh goody
and i grabbed my dick and co-stuck in her puddy
started rocking this freak with my hands on her butt
you should have seen in her booty i was tearin it up
next i whispered in her ear baby please turn over
and rocked doggie style while i was calling her rover
still tearin it up on her face was a grin
holdin' on to her waist pumping harder than sin
but she was lovin' it all with her back in a arch
i busted my nut and she started to bark
arf... arf... arf
uh
arf... arf... arf
uh
arf... arf... arf
na na bop but nop but

now if you think the story is over just listen to this
i thought my mission was complete so i gave her a kiss
then i was searchin for a towel to clean off my dickie
'cause it was kinda wet all bloody and sticky
and to talk about gross heres something sicker than sick
i started trippin' cause this was something i've never seen
the girl was more than a freak she was a sexual fiend
and when i thought that was as gross as one girl could get
she stuck her finger in her booty and then she licked it
oh now this girl was much more to me than a freak
in my opinion she was plain nasty
but never the less i completed my duty
i got this freak and co-waxed the booty

wax that booty
co-wax the booty
i got the freak and i waxed her booty
i love the booty, you love the booty
hey freak come here and let me wax your booty

too short don't stop
too short don't stop
too short don't stop the beat
biiiiiiiitch

now if you like the booty come on fellas show it
this is your last verse to wax so why would you blow it
and if the ladies if you are tired of a man on your fanny
with the number one wax and me kid rock
so let's get hyped 'cause if i see you calm
i am gonna think that you are waxin with rosie palm
i mean really how could you be so dumb
just look at all the girls that are dying to get some
man, just don't be a wussy
but to get it you have to realize
don't brag to the freak about your dick size
man, that's not the way to win it
cause it is not the length of your wand it's the magic in it

wax that booty
co-wax the booty
freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty

wax that booty
co-wax the booty
i got freaks and i wax those booties

tryin' to blow my rap down the sink
but go ahead cause my rap's made of brick
and it sticks
kicks
hits
and uplifts
at shows, it flows but never drifts
it's too swift and moves with quickness
top dog again and you say what is this
it's the under rated mc on top
the young six foot one kid rock
look at the black man, now what's up
he's not a skin head, that's the abdul jabar cut

okay... yeah
get down
come back
the black man from new jersey
kdc

i think you might like to hear something from us

stand up
put your hands up
come on get up
kid rock's in the house yo, ready to pick up
the tempo and you know in so i will fo somewhat unconventional
but comprehendible
i'm the presentable the good lookin'
the mello yellow young fellow and i'm cookin
heatin the house up just like a hot plate
smooth on the groove like an ice skate
you didn't think in a blink i'd stand here
but now you're in fear and stand clear
you can't come near this hot stylin
groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin
also the perfect lyric announcer
on the set with a cold forty ouncer
ready to glide from side to side
why, 'cause i step in stride

these are the criteria i believe should be applied
'cause i step in stride
these are the criteria i believe should be applied

n-n-now yes i'm new
but before i'm through
your gonna see i paddle my own canoe
'cause i'm solo
a young pro on the go
close to an angel
but i wear no halo
i just shake, create, and never act fake
and i learned to dislike and not hate
because hatred leads to an uproar
violence is one thing i am not here for
i'm just here flat out and to blow the roof
kick some watts and that's what i inted to do
pump it up like an air comb presser
teach to each like a wise professor
no job i strive to reach high
make the girls in the house all sigh
and i'll glide from side to side
why, 'cause i step in stride

these are the criteria i believe should be applied
i step in stride
these are the criteria i believe should be applied

applied, step in stride you bet i do
get you high like a bottle of german brew
comin' clean
new on the scene
makin' girls scream if you know what i mean
'cause they dream of me to rock the place
and put a big smile upon their face
any girl of any race
but they have to like the b-b-bass
and that's the rep i've earned and kept on the set
workin up a sweat
no jive kid rock uparrivd
and i step in stride

these are the criteria i believe should be applied
i step in stride
these are the criteria i believe should be applied
thee... thee... thee... thee
these are the criteria
thee... thee... thee... thee
these are the criteria i believe should be applied applied... applied... applied... applied
applied... plied... plied... plied


white boy get ready to do his thing's here

here's a new jam for you to cling to
a funky rhythm that you can swing to
kid rock that's me

and round and round
upside down
can't you turn me inside out
and round and round

the bass drops and works its hardest
for kid rock the new young rap artist
clockin paper 'cause i got soul
comin' at you from the motor capital
shakin booties
not all the cuties
i'm too cool to be a little fruity
drinkin' forties every weekend
i'm the master who's always speakin'
to some freak and if i freak her
it's at red roof inn where we sleep cheaper
but off that topic got to get it
super dope, extremely poetic
the k-i-d-r-o-c-kin
i love girls that's how its layin
with these jammies
all i care about is shaking fannies
and i have been doin' it for a long time
but now i'm nineteen
and in my prime
waxin booties everyday while the girls say

upside down
can't you turn me inside out
and round and round
upside down
can't you turn me inside out
and round and round

on the mic is solo
'cause i'm the kid with all the dope lingos
only rappin' 'cause i don't sing dope
create a jam that's fresh in your bingo
lace up the reebox
comb the high top
black dose with a little hip hop
and i style it with some uniqueness
you say i'm not fresh
but i could careless
one of a kind
when i rock the mic
and i'm the one that your girl is likin
picture the girless women not lookin'
create a beat that is fully hookin
'cause when i get dumb
people have fun
sisco save me the magnum
in a hell of a show i always display
while the girls say

and round and round

non-commercial lyrics run like hershel
walkin' fast 'cause i'm a smooth talker
appeal the feel, but don't praise and kneel
just heal
and always look for the seal that's real
top dog, lookin' up to say what is this
kid rock serious and i mean business
ascending up and up i keep boosting
makin' hit records like whitney houston
with a mind of violence, right, i might
blow the show teachers speakin' yo, i cut mp's
to release to each and be friends of
every single, individual

everybody all over the world, it's time for understandin
come together

jumbo, yo that's how i'm movin
i'm the new kid in, here's what i'm givin'
a jammed, slammin', command that take authority
cause too many mc's appear apsrt of me
name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'
a lotta just came in, sound the same in
thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men
but i keep the crowd swingin' like tarzan
'cause i'm a wise man here to teach and speak
so come with it, kid rock's gonna get it
his style ain't dope, it's a throat, and i slit it
i'm raw like cowhide, smooth like a plane ride
no half steppin, i always take a full stride
who came played and they say i'm concrete made
i used to come correct in the projects
new port, oxford, deep in the basement
house and parties like real estate agent
so on, so strong, and everyone got along
knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
come together
everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
come together

now as i said my prayers through the years i shed a few tears
'cause it's unjust when i see my peers get shot
and dropped and forgot, now that's hot
too many can't score as victims of a drug war
cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out
the press finds out, then the public is tripped out
new tax the acts and half the drug industry
uncle sam is my man, are you kiddin me
for one to get over, one must get stuck up
one will roll up, another will smoke up
two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up
tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there
eyes bugged out and hands in the air
cause there comes an onlooker, lookin' for a hooker
and act like the doors overlooked her and took her
for a place to hide and when he got his ride
he let the nice slide and the girl, she died
her family cried over this homicide
and why they pondered, why she wandered
left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop
all to smoke a little cooked up rock
so on and so strong, she couldn't get along
knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
come together
everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
come together

from the outskirts with a mind like albert einstein
maybe i'm ahead of my time
imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states
surrounded by the great lakes
i was once out cold at 15 years old
rolled and sold, you, me, and bo
sittin' in jackson infested with rats
with a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks
i was a young bad mother in my own eyes
but now i realize it wasn't too wise
so now i teach, i'll reach to each
and every single individual

everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
come together
come together
come together
come... come... come... come together


people like the way my style is rollin'
the crowd rebounds as i flow slowin
heres how i'm hittin
funkin it up more than george clinton
swingin', and bringin' in a new format
a new breed indeed and i'm sure of that
i'll impress the best, i won't rest the best
'cause i'm blessed and i just won't settle for less
yes the kid who gets the crowd up
the one with the hair that stands straight up
people look and stare in shock

trippin' over a rock
trippin' over a rock

chased and chased and chased, but never close to caught
and the skills i filled were all self taught
with so many styles on each panfulls
and they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels
as the girls admire the way i aspire
to move higher and build my own empire
not a liar, i tell no lies
so hey girl you can trust these blue eyes
but don't get me wrong i get wicked
shake that ass in my face and i'll stick it
hit it, get wit it
knock it out the box

trippin' over a rock
trippin' over a rock

a genuine badman
like yosemite sam man
i c-c-c-can rock the land
and bring a new swing and sensation
to represent the next generation
so slack up, you better back up
come the score and you leave in a jigsaw
with no doubt
i'll put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out
i'll go deep in i won't weaken
guarenteed to keep the house leapin
girls flockin guys
try to to cockblock

cause everybody's trippin' over a rock


i had a realization of god, i saw god and umm,
its not a face or a figure or anything it was a presence,
the universe, everything you, me were part of god,
were part of god it was an incredible feeling
and to use acid is religious for me


kid rock that's right you know i'm back ho
from the dead where i had to lay low
seems strange but i ain't changed nothing
in the flesh and i guess i'm the best
for the pimp in the pimp of the nation
all we need to learn is how to hold hands
then we could live in peace in my homeland
god damn the way my pain swells
i spend all my time killin' brain cells
the light shed on me was a dim gleam
so i live life in a bottle of jim beam
droppin' dots or sniffin' that blow black,
roll with zig zags like to read skin mags
when i shoot i never miss
and if i played the bass i'd probably pluck it like this...
people wanna know what i'm thinkin' but i don't care
so i keep my thoughts in a bottle of cuervo
just a wild young buck
'cause i still be clownin' suckers be frownin'
forties of busch i be poundin'
i ain't dead in the head like manson
hanson brother style when i'm rumblin'
couple of shots of don q and i be stumblin'
fumblin' footballs hangin' in the pool halls
i'm not into havin' clean fun
i step into the party strapped with a machine gun
but i'm no gangster like gotti
"i'm just an m.c. to put the boogie in the party"
back in black plus a new track
and i won't quit till your ears blow from feedback
when i shoot i never miss
and if i played the guitar i'd probably strum it like this...
and today i know you don't wanna get shot
you look gay you're too cliche
your little plan was a flop
tryin' to get 'em on by sellin out the kid rock
a part of me was with you but yo he died,
and i'm glad you stepped off 'cause i ain't givin' no free rides
you little bald headed peon
'cause i'm sure i'm sure ya
are gonna try to come back around but i'll ignore ya
it only takes one shot to floor ya
better jet so 'cause i won't let no hoes from the metro
take mine "what up doe"
come look son i'm number one...
in the twilight zone with rod serling
when i shoot i never miss
and if i played the harmonica i'd probably blow it like this...


'cause growin' up i was never
the logical one
like the prodigal son
with a bottle of jack
and my shotgun strapped
i went looking for fame
and yo i've never been back

filled with spite
staying high as a kite
i was dealing and stealing
everything in sight
pool hustling
trying to make that green
i've been ramblin and gamblin
since the age of 13

like a god damn tank
some disagree because
my rents had bank
but all that's gold
don't always glitter
so i'll take another puff
from my one hitter

i'm a slave to the trade
i'm paid to rhyme
blow all my cash
on cheap women and wine
'cause money, money, money
but i gotta make a lot
just to be free

i'm here and i'm there
i'm here and i'm there
i'm kid rock, ho and i'm everywhere

i hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
she holds in that morning time and never lets me go
i hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

please god please
i'll pay any cost
if you'd just stop the world
'cause i wanna get off
there's too much hardship
there's too much pain
tryin' to get in my brain

i've been to your mountains
i've been to your seaside
and everywhere i went
somebody's wanted a free ride
but parasites can't fake the rock
and any suckers that step in my way are getting shot

'cause i hold key
to my own success
and suckers that step
shall be put to rest
i hold the key
to my own success
and suckers that step
will catch a bullet in their chest

so pass the buddha
the funky tie hooter
and watch me rip
because i'm such a slick shooter
not a generic dime-
a-dozen m.c.
never was in a posse
never wanted to be

i'm here and i'm there
i'm here and i'm there
i'm kid rock, ho and i'm everywhere

i hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
she holds in that morning time and never lets me go
i hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

now i've been walking the earth
since the beginning of time
and won't leave till
i've received that 7th sign
all this talk
their gonna drop the bomb
but life keeps going
on and on and on and on

the world's end
don't worry me
and i'm gonna get where i'm going
just don't hurry me
'cause i'm in no rush
and i can't stand rushin
everything is slow motion
like i'm trippin' on tussin'

fussin with the girls
they waste my time
thrashin and bashin
going out of my mind
crucified by the critics
everyday
'cause i really ain't got
that much to say

i'm a slave to the trade
i'm paid to rhyme
i don't wear a watch
and i don't keep time
i live my life
just like the skipper
because i'm a day tripper

twitchin, shakin
and i get more bass
then john paul jones
visions of red shoot through my head
and i won't stop trippin'
till the day i'm dead

i'm here and i'm there
i'm here and i'm there
i'm kid rock hoe and i'm everywhere

i hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
she holds in that morning time and never lets me go
i hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

yeah... yeah... yeah on down
hey... hey, hey... hey, hey, hey, hey
on down, on down, on down, down, down, down, down
well, well, well, well
hey heeeeeeeeeey
get back on the streets and get my money
money, money, money, money, money, money
get my money
you can have my car if it will drive you crazy
crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

get back on the streets and get my money
you can have my car if it will drive you crazy


have you ever known a free lancer
thinks that he's a camper
known around my way as the cramper
like p.m.s. always pokin'

but he won't go away with a little motrin
now if you ever heard the term cramper and you wonder
the worms kinda like i guess a modern day felix unger
when ya first meet 'em ya think he's o.k

but then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way
he squawks and he gawks and he walks a thin line

he always wants to get high but never has a bag
never works says he can't find the right job
ain't got a dime and when he does he's a tightwad
he's the dampest there's no one damp

now the crampers red, there's no one redder
he rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater
he's sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer

you come home he's at your house drinkin' your last beer
pokin' and strokin' he makes you want to belt him
and then sporty's never that cautious

he sips from your forty and he always backwashes
talk about a certain subject, he'll jinx it
let him borrow a shirt, the stooge always shrinks it
he's the dampest, there's no one damper



i trip i rip and though i think i'm slick
i'm nothin' but a funky country hick
but i still get down with a sound that pumps
and you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump
never been questioned by the f.b.i
although i've tried every method just to get high
l.s.d. is what i'm trippin' on
a big fat booty's what i'm grippin on
but for now i'm gonna rock and keep rippin on
as i co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem
no brain no pain... now c'mon y'all and tell me what's my name

kid rock rock
kid rock rock
come on, come on
what's my name
kid rock rock
kid rock rock
kid rock rock
kid rock rock

kid rock rock
kid rock rock
now break it down like this

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state i'm in
half off the wagon with my feet draggin
taggin hoes gettin' lots of trim
gettin' jocks and props for all the spots i rock
i'm true i'm blue like captain kangaroo
and for the few who knew yo i'm a bang for you
and i ain't no radio wanna get rich ho
so count my props you can't get with me
but hoes with guns playin' hard for fun
so stay off my dick because i ain't the one
for anyone tryin' to bust
and i show no shame 'cause i'm down for mine
now tell me what's my name

i am the bullgod
i am free
and i feed on all that is forsaken
i'm gonna get you
i see through you
i'm gonna get you

i'm like a train i roll hard, lettin' off much steam
in the carhart flannel and dusty jeans baby
i never was cool with james dean
but i be hanging tough with my man jim beam
i swing low like a chimp
back in '86 man i was seein' a shrink
but now i'm humble and i can only think
about new orleans and those jumbo shrimp
so ask no questions and i'll tell no lies
i got big ol' pupils and blood shot eyes
i'm on the brink if you know what i mean
and a 12 step program couldn't keep me clean
'cause i'm the bullgod, you understand
the illegitimate son of man
the t o p to the d o g
or the p o t to the g o d

and i'm trippin'
said i'm trippin'

i am the bullgod
i am free
and i feed on all that is forsaken
i'm gonna get you
i see through you
i'm gonna get you

a lot of people poke fun and that's all right
but when i start pokin' back they get all uptight
you can't cap with the master son
so sit your ass down before i blast you one
'cause i'm so greasy you can call me mud
and i feel a little hank runnin' through my blood
i wanna flood the world with my twisted thoughts
you can bet all day but i can't be bought
uh break it up let's tie one on
i gotta get set to go and cut the lawn
so i grab my walkman but before i cut
i got behind the garage and fire it up
'cause i'm the bullgod, you understand
the illegitimate son of man
the t o p to the d o g
or the p o t to the g o d

and i'm trippin'
said i'm trippin'
and you know...

i am the bullgod
i am free
and i feed on all that is forsaken
forsaken, yeah!

you ain't nothing

yeah yeah yeah yeah
come on get 'em up
come on get 'em up
come on get 'em up

i am the bullgod
i am free
i am free
and i feed on all that is...

i get a feeling of peace, from a low so high
as i sit in my chair and watch life go by
these thoughts i have can't mold to sense
through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense
born and raised in the outer lands
and at times you can say i'm outta hand
i'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run
every time that paper hits my tongue
and sometimes it seems so odd
when my veins are popping and i'm on the nod
i am the bullgod, you understand
and here in my head is my master plan

uh, i'm gonna get you
i see through you
i'm gonna get you
i see through you!


i'm not the trash you think i am talking trailor park
i'll take you higher, higher
i'll take you lower, slower
i'll make you talk that talk and walk that walk hoe

i see you checkin' out my car and my residence
your hell bound and i see your gettin' whiskey bent
i been around and i know what you meant




i like that long hair swingin' in them calvin klines



my six shooter strapped and i'm lookin' for a battle
out on the plains i'm just a loner
my saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin' me a boner
i got thoughts of annie oakley
but that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me
i gave my last gold tooth 'n' gold nugget to get my dick sucked
3 days out on the frontier
and i'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer
i need a slut for a service
i take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous
man i gotta get my rocks off
'cause my wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft
didn't take any practice
a desperate rado
got a cock like a cactus
now i drift through the desert like a wild coyote
horny as a toad trippin' off peyote
holdin' uptrains and gettin' goods by the sack
i'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack
and to the law i'm no stranger
i'm wanted dead or alive 'cause i shot the lone ranger
and then tonto tried to get down
that's the way i run my show
paint towns red
i know you think i'm archaic
but my dick's like a sword
out on the plains it gets linely
sometimes i feel homely
new faces
new towns no one knows me
guns cocked in my holster
u see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster
i'm always lookin' for the quick buck
some say my head's hollow
trottin through the bad lands
a desperate rado
tokin down with all the cowhands
a desperate rado
didn't take much practice
a desperate rado
got a cock like a cactus
in any town i can be found at the local bordello
never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin,
and when i'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons
so when i rip through your town don't be gawkin
just tip your hat and tex keep walkin'
'cause i'm a gun slingin top hand
i'm a low down buckaroo
'cause i'm a sidewinding nomad
and morals in upbringing is something that i never had
known as the ruff ridin' texan
a bad buck from the day of my inception.
and i was raised in the poor house
my mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house
now since the day i left the corral
i've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal
'cause pale rider once pulled me aside
and told me that high was the best way to ride...
always lookin' for a fight
a desperate rado
puffin on a peace pipe
i'm a desperate rado
on the run from the law
a desperate rado baddest one you ever saw


back from the dead second l.p. here we go
comin' at ya from the r.o.m.e.o.
pistol packed with a crew'o fly slimmys
hat turned back in some airwalk jimmys
never slackin' hoes i be mackin
not wacked i don't try to act black when
i came up i came at ya from the outskirts
bag of weed in the pocket of my sweatshirt
bone 2 the bone 2 the bad 2 the bad 2 the bone
hit bound from the mo-town allen
i started out in mount clemens as a d.j.
park parties gettin' drunk on sunday
an now i've toured this nation
pimp of the nation
pullin hoes
rock the set in each city then step
me, blackman and funk daddy def stef
but all i want baby is your grits for breakfast
eggs, bacon, home cooked fries
triple x on the set showin no class
no fool i went 2 high school dumb ass
smoked dope and i flunked every class
slash and i smash 'cause i thrash when i bash


invite me to a party and your house'll get trashed
an outcast sick of being harassed so i dashed
moved out of the crib 'cause i hated cuttin' grass
now i reside on the eastside lovin' it
cold 40 dog in a brown bag chuggin it
flex, sex, run of the next
flippin and trippin' and rippin and shakin the suckers who wanted 2
front an get around 2 the
2 get up or get down 2 the rhyme
i'm shakin and takin' and breakin i rip the mic like
kickin back coolin with a cold grits sandwich
somebody said i'm the best in the mo-town
who ever said it they lied they fessed
wanna be heard when i rap so i yell it
sport a tigers cap like my man tom selleck
so jive records yo, go and suck a fat dick
'cause i'm rippin like a chainsaw
yes i'm that raw laughin' at ya suckers like hee haw
roll it up, take a hit and then pass it
that's how we do it when we roll down gratiot
in my grand marquis i pimp to the beat
two in the front and two hoes in the back seat


i need somebody won't you help me
i need somebody won't you tell me who i am
i've been livin' a lie so long it seems i've lived a life time
if you could see what i feel it would make your ghetto look like heaven
and i believe it stems down from my family situation
i never liked my old man
i couldn't stand to be around him
sometimes i sit all alone just starin' at his picture, yeah
my heart turns to stone and i think of this

i need somebody won't you help me
i need somebody won't you tell me who i am
you never loved me, you never held me tight
you tried to make me think that your ways were best
when all i was was an outlet for all your stress

life it's the ultimate sin
a game with no rules that you're expected to win
my personal hell's hidden with a grin
dad take the stand and let the trial begin
you said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool
uyoushould've went to school like your bigger brother
but you played the fool with a different color
runnin' ship with a whip
i tried to keep up but i kept getting tripped
money made you so wise
how could you look through my face and not see your own eyes
do as i say and not as i do
but i can't 'cause when i look in the mirror i see you
and oh the pain how it hurts
it was always your home and your business that came first
you said a man is as good as his word
but your mind was closed and mine never heard
my visions blurred, thoughts obscured
and with my blinders down i strain from the heard
they say the nut don't fall far from the tree
look at you then look at me...

you ain't nothin' to me you've never been to me
and it's the day that i die of this hate that i'm free

now i know growin' up son that it ain't always been easy
and i know at times i was not always there for you
no we never spent much time just talkin' or havin' a good time
but understand growin' up son i never had a dime
so i worked my ass off and i put myself through college
and everything i have to this day you know i built it all
oh i wish i could go back and change the years that's lost between us
i wish i could take back some of the things i said to you
son i said i'm sorry but still you resent me so
son i said i'm sorry and why do you resent me so

i always loved you i always cared for you
just never wanted you to go through what i've been through
and now i'm hated like the devil and for why i don't know
dah

all right, get down baby
yeah

i need somebody won't you help me
i need somebody won't you tell me who i am
i need somebody please, please help me
i need somebody you must tell me who i am

hey, hey, hey
tell me who i am
hey, hey
tell me who i am
i am, i am
tell me who i am, am, am
tell meeeee
tell meeeee

if it looks good, you'll see it.
if it sounds good, you'll hear it.
if it's marketed right, you'll buy it.
but... if it's real, you'll feel it.


cruisin through town in my jacked up truck
eyes open 'cause i'm scopin for a big butt slut
one that i can take straight back to my house
and that will suck my dick and put my balls in her mouth
now get get with it look across the street

so i gapped up my 40 stuck it under my seat
rolled up on the freak and i started to speak
but before i could talk, she goes and grabbed my dick
she said look here i know you're kid rock
well blow me up and then blow me down
'cause i think i just found the biggest freak in town
and now i can't wait to get her back to my house
set her on her knees and put my balls in her mouth

balls in your mouth
ballls in your mouth

went back to my crib with no delay
big grin on my gril with not much to say
i drop my drawers and put my balls in your mouth
then it was like straight audible porn
and after that, without a doubt
she opened up wide and put my balls in her mouth
next the cutie started rubbin my back
and she put her finger right between my bootie and crack
so i grabbed her wrist quick and said hold up slut
"ain't nobody stickin nuttin in my butt"
now right then i knew i had a hoe and a half
and all that i could do was sit back and laugh
stare at the ceilin thinkin' about
this chick i just met's got my balls in her mouth

balls in your mouth
balllls in your mouth
2x

after i busted my nuts i drove her to the cut
...and please don't tell anyone wat we've been through")
spread the news to the whole damn town
and to that chick, it musta got back around
so i told the hoe sorry and tried to make our mends
but she tried to front me in front of my friends
i just waited till she walked away to shout

balls in your mouth
ballls in your mouth

how i long to drink some wine again with you

i can take to the skies
i can soar like a bird with its heart full of song
won't you color my eyes
i've been waiting so long

you can make me free
you can make me cry
you can make it so much better
if you would only try

and if i must wait a lonely lifetime

i can soar like a bird with his heart full of song
won't you cover my eyes
i've been waiting so long

you can make me free
you can make me cry
you can make it so much better
if you would only try

and if i must wait a lonely lifetime
until i am with you, my love

baby all the lights are turned on you
now you're in the center of the stage
everything revolves on what you do
ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age

and you can always have your way somehow
but everybody loves you now

you can walk away from your mistakes
you can turn your back on what you do
just a little smile is all it takes
yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too

loneliness will get to you somehow
but everybody loves you now

ah, they all want your white body
and they await your reply
ah, but between you and me and the staten island ferry
so do i

all the people want to know your name
soon there will be lines outside your door
feelings do not matter in your game
yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore

so your life is only living anyhow
and everybody loves you now

close your eyes when you don't want to see
stay at home when you don't want to go
only speak to those who will agree
yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know

you have lost your innocence somehow
but everybody loves you now

ah, you know that nothing lasts forever
and it's all been done before
ah, but you ain't got the time to go to cold spring harbor
no more

see how all the people gather 'round
hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl?
keep your eyes ahead and don't look down
yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall

this is what you wanted; ain't you proud?
'cause everybody loves you now


of all the people in the world that i know
you're the best place to go
when i cry, when i cry

i never asked for much before, not before
things are changed; i need more
tell me why, judy, why?

i never thought that she would say
say goodbye; but she did
and now i wanna die. i wanna die

i never thought that i would need, need a friend
but i did, in the end
tell me why, judy, why

oh, what a scene
it's wrong for her to hang me up this way
oh, where you been?
'cause it's so hard to make it through the day

a man my age is very young, so i'm told
why do i feel so old?
tell me why, judy, why?
oh, what a scene
it's wrong for her to hang me up this way
oh, where you been?
'cause it's so hard to make it through the day

there's no tomorrow 'cause my dreams did not last
so i live in the past
tell me why, judy, why?


once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
there stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
he painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
and he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain

in the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
and she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
she was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
'cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall?
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
ah, but i don't want to know and i don't want to see
another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

high upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
with his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
and his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
but he will not see the fallin' of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall?
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
ah, but i don't want to know and i don't want to see
another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

so now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
but the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
and it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
'cause you can't stop the fallin' rain.


oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream
you don't look back because you know your hands are clean
you make believe the past was just a dream
you make believe the past was just a dream

turn around, turn around
and i will sing for you a song
i don't know where you been
but you've been gone too long

oh, elisa, you must begin again
and all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end
i was your lover but i thought i was your friend
i loved you but i thought i was your friend

turn around, turn around
and i will sing for you a song
i don't know where you been
but you've been gone too long

oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea
maybe you will find a little time to think of me
won't you please remember what i tried so hard to be
yeah, remember what i tried so hard to be

so turn around, turn around
and i will sing for you a song
and i don't know where you been
but you've been gone too long


ah, you look so good to me
with my eyes open wide, i can see
ah, you feel so good to me
and it's so good when you're here 'cause i'm free

feelin' the glory from that smile upon your face
it's liftin' me high above my ordinary place
and i am so happy when i'm in your warm embrace

ah, you look so good to me
with my eyes open wide, i can see
ah, you feel so good to me
and who knows what your next move will be?

ah, you look so good to me
with my eyes open wide, i can see
ah, you feel so good to me
and it's so good when you're here 'cause i'm free


i've been livin' for the moment
but i just can't have my way
and i'm afraid to go to sleep
'cause tomorrow is today

people tell me life is sweeter
but i don't hear what they say
nothing comes to change my life
so tomorrow is today

i don't care to know the hour
'cause it's passing anyway
i don't have to see tomorrow
'cause i saw it yesterday

so i listen for an answer
but the feeling seems to stay
and what's the use of always dreaming
if tomorrow is today

still i'm waiting for the morning
but it feels so far away
and you don't need the love i'm giving
so tomorrow is today

oh, my. goin' to the river
gonna take a ride and the lord will deliver me
made my bed, now i'm gonna lie in it
if you don't come, i'm sure gonna die in it
too late. too much given
i've seen a lot of life and i'm damn sick of livin' it
i keep hopin' that you will pass my way

and some day if your dreams are leavin' you
i'll still believe in you

i don't care to know the hour
'cause it's passing anyway
i don't have to see tomorrow
'cause i saw it yesterday

though i'm living and i'm singing
and although my hands still play
soon enough it will all be over
'cause tomorrow is today


well so here i am at the end of the road
where do i go from here?
i always figured it would be like this
still nothing seems to be quite clear

all the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled
but i just can't decide where to go
yes, it's been quite a day and i should go to sleep
but tomorrow i will wake up and i'll know

that i've got to begin again
though i don't know how start
yes, i've got to begin again
and it's hard

well it's been quite a while since i lifted my head
and i'm sure the light will hurt my eyes
i see the way that i been spendin' my days
and reality has caught me by surprise

i was dreamin' of tomorrow so i sacrificed today
and it sure was a grand waste of time
and despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face
i just can't get you out of my mind

that i've got to begin again
though i don't know how start
yes, i've got to begin again
and it's hard


hey lord, take a look all around
and i'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
'cause she is far across the sea

and make sure that she's gonna be alright
and things are gonna be alright with me

and make sure that all her dreams are sweet
said now, would ya guide her on the roads
and make them softer for her feet

and make sure that she's gonna be alright
until she's home and here with me

if she is sleepin' under the sky
said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
is always warm and dry

mmm, don'tcha give her too much rain
try to keep her away from pain
because my baby hates to cry

'cause it gets rough along the way
said now, this song seems strange is just because
i don't know how to pray

mmm, won'tcha give her peace of mind
and if you ever find the time
won'tcha tell her i miss her everyday

hey lord, take a look all around
and i'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
'cause she is far across the sea

and make sure that she's gonna be alright
until she's home and here with me
with me


it's nine o'clock on a saturday
the regular crowd shuffles in
there's an old man sitting next to me
making love to his tonic and gin

he says, "son, can you play me a memory?
i'm not really sure how it goes
but it's sad and it's sweet, and i knew it complete
when i wore a younger man's clothes"

la, la, la, de, de, da
la, la, de, de, da, da, da

sing us a song, you're the piano man
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling all right

now john at the bar is a friend of mine
he gets me my drinks for free
and he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
but there's someplace that he'd rather be

he says, "bill, i believe this is killing me"
as the smile ran away from his face
"well, i'm sure that i could be a movie star
if i could get out of this place"

oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
la, la, de, de, da, da, da

now paul is a real estate novelist
who never had time for a wife
and he's talking with davy, who's still in the navy
and probably will be for life

and the waitress is practicing politics
as the businessmen slowly get stoned
yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but it's better than drinking alone

sing us a song, you're the piano man
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling all right

it's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
and the manager gives me a smile
'cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
to forget about life for a while

and the piano, it sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say, "man, what are you doing here?"

oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
la, la, de, de, da, da, dum

sing us a song, you're the piano man
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling all right

nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
gotta get ready to go

and just as surely as the wind keeps blowin'
the grass keeps growin', you gotta keep goin'
and the lord'll have mercy on your soul

oooh, yeah, lord, lord
la la la la, ooh


when you look into my eyes
and you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
it always comes as a surprise
when i feel my withered roots begin to grow

well i never had a place that i could call my very own
that's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home

when you touch my weary head
and you tell me everything will be all right
you say, "use my body for your bed

well, i'll never be a stranger and i'll never be alone
whenever we're together, that's my home

home can be the pennsylvania turnpike
indiana's early morning dew
high up in the hills of california
home is just another word for you

well i never had a place that i could call my very own
that's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home

if i travel all my life
and i never get to stop and settle down
long as i have you by my side
there's a roof above and good walls all around

you're my castle, you're my cabin and my instant pleasure dome
i need you in my house 'cause you're my home
you're my home


from a town known as wheeling, west virginia
rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand
and his daring life of crime
made him a legend in his time
east and west of the rio grande

well, he started with a bank in colorado
in the pocket of his vest, a colt he hid
and his age and his size
took the teller by surprise
and the word spread of billy the kid

well he never travelled heavy
yes, he always rode alone
and he soon put many older guns to shame
and he never had a sweetheart
and he never had a home
but the cowboys and the ranchers knew his name

well he robbed his way from utah to oklahoma
and the law just could not seem to track him down
and it served his legend well
for the folks they love to tell
'bout when billy the kid came to town

well, one cold day a posse captured billy
and the judge said, "string 'im up for what he did."
and the cowboys and their kin
like the sea came pourin' in
to watch the hangin' of billy the kid

well he never travel'ed heavy
yes, he always rode alone
and he soon put many older guns to shame
well he never had a sweetheart
but he finally found a home
underneath the boot hill grave that bears his name

from a town known as oyster bay, long island
rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand
and his daring life of crime
made him a legend in his time
east and west of the rio grande

he always found it hard to take her
she wouldn't listen to advice
and though he never tried to make her
she often thought it would be nice

oh, and now she's headin' out to california
it's been a long time comin'
and she left a little letter
said she's gonna make a stop in nevada
goodbye, goodbye

she tried for years to be a good wife
it never quite got off the ground
and all those stories of the good life
convinced her not to hang around

oh, and now she's headin' out to california

but she sure knows what she's leavin' behind
and she left a little letter
said she's gonna make a stop in nevada

that make a woman run away

if i only had the words to tell you
if you only had the time to understand
though i know it wouldn't change your feelings
and i know you'll carry on the best you can

if i only had the urge to tell you
if you only knew how hard it is to say
when the simple lines have all been taken
and the radio repeats them every day

if i never find the song to sing you
if you always find it hard to comprehend
well, you know there wouldn't be much meaning
if i had to sing those tired words again

life goes on and on
but if we try we can be sure

if you only had the time to understand
but i only have these arms to hold you
and it's all that you can ask of any man

well, you know i love my woman
and i would not let her down
and i did my share of lovin'
when i used to get around

now i'm satisfied that she is lookin' fine
oh, but you pay for satisfaction
somewhere along the line

somewhere along the line

hey, it's good to be a young man
and to live the way you please

of every kingdom that he sees

there's an old and feeble man not far behind

and you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
oh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
what went wrong, mmm

once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
there stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
he painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
and he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain

in the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
and she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
she was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
'cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall?
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
ah, but i don't want to know and i don't want to see
another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

high upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
with his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
and his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
but he will not see the fallin' of the rain

will it always be the same as we recall?
does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
ah, but i don't want to know and i don't want to see
another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

so now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
but the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
and it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
'cause you can't stop the fallin' rain.


hey lord, take a look all around
and i'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
'cause she is far across the sea

and make sure that she's gonna be alright
and things are gonna be alright with me

and make sure that all her dreams are sweet
said now, would ya guide her on the roads
and make them softer for her feet

and make sure that she's gonna be alright
until she's home and here with me

if she is sleepin' under the sky
said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
is always warm and dry

mmm, don'tcha give her too much rain
try to keep her away from pain
because my baby hates to cry

'cause it gets rough along the way
said now, this song seems strange is just because
i don't know how to pray

mmm, won'tcha give her peace of mind
and if you ever find the time
won'tcha tell her i miss her everyday

hey lord, take a look all around
and i'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
'cause she is far across the sea

and make sure that she's gonna be alright
until she's home and here with me
with me

as far as i can see


show me a sign that i love you
blow me a mind as you always do
remind me to tell you that i've come to
believe in the beauty, the power of you
woman, dissolve into the sea
the body of water is calling me
the god of my daughter is always free
there's nothing to solve and you're solving me

ooh, i'm in your company
ooh, body that's calling me
ooh, i'm in your company

throw me a line i could use one
i special-design me 'cause i'm your son
two thousand below where i feel my love
the body of water where i come from

i'm dreaming, got a reason to steal
fire from the other side out there
formations flow like screams

i'm made with a life to spare
get the jizz, mister sism? got a rhythm
technology of a prayer
scientist to the prism of faith
and hope so i am there

baby i'm old, can you come here?
the science of love is becoming clear
invisible love with the color still
i need to a place in the atmosphere
and i may believe...


there's a port on a western bay
and it serves a hundred ships a day
lonely sailors pass the time away
and talk about their homes

and there's a girl in this harbor town
and she works layin' whiskey down
they say, "brandy, fetch another round"
she serves them whiskey and wine

"yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"

brandy wears a braided chain
made of finest silver from the north of spain
a locket that bears the name
of the man that brandy loves

he came on a summer's day
bringin' gifts from far away
but he made it clear he couldn't stay
no harbor was his home

"but my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"

yeah, brandy used to watch his eyes
when he told his sailor stories
she could feel the ocean foam rise
she saw its ragin' glory

but he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man
and brandy does her best to understand

brandy walks through a silent town
and loves a man who's not around
she still can hear him say

"but my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"


"but my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"

they say, in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it
oh, i do you
a funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated
hey now, every time i lose altitude

you took a town by storm, the mess you made was nominated
oh, i do you
now, put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've over stayed it
hey now, every time i lose altitude

so divine, hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune's faded

the medicated state of mind you've found is over-rated
oh, i do you
you saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it
hey now, every time i lose altitude

so divine, hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune's faded

come on god, do i seem bullet proof...

so divine, hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune's faded

so divine, hell of an elevator
all the while my fortune faded
never mind the consequences of the crime
this time my fortune's faded




it must have been your funny face
it must have been your love
must have been your paper chase
that wasn't quite enough

must have been your tiny dance that
made me laugh out loud
must have been your angel dust that
put me on your cloud

you're the reason why
you're the reason i

it must have been your love
it must have been your love... i said

it must have been your love... in a little bit
it must have been your love

it must have been your poppy eyes
that made me step outside
it must have been the sight of tears that
let me know i cried

it must have been your bunny shake
it must have been your love
a lot of girls won't come around they
treat me like a wolf

it must have been your love
it must have been your love... i said
it must have been your love... i gotta give it that
it must have been your love

you're my angel, baby
you're my darling
you're my star
lo-lo-lo-lolita
let her see me deep in love

you're the reason why
you're the reason i

it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love

you're my angel baby
you're my darling
you're my star
lo-lo-lo-lolita
let her see me deep in love

lopsided eyes and a crooked frown
make more of life, just settle down
every single little princess needs a crown
make more of life, just settle down

it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love
it must have been your love


ooh

there ain't no jesus gonna come from the sky
now that i found out i know i can cry

i, i found out!
i, i found out!

some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand
don't get you nowhere don't make you a man
i heard something 'bout my ma and my pa
they didn't want me so they made me a star

i, i found out!
i, i found out!

old hare krishna got nothing on you
just keep you crazy with nothing to do
keep you occupied with pie in the sky
there ain't no guru who can see through your eyes

i, i found out!
i, i found out!

i've seen through junkies, i've been through it all
i seen religion from jesus to paul
don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine
no one can harm you, feel your own pain

i, i found out!
i, i found this out!
i, i found out!


bang on my window if
you want to get your look out
i felt the wind blow when
she took her little book out

i'm steady loving on the
lady of these pages
another chapter if you will
so advantageous

take off your glasses and fight

under the hula moon i'm
going to pop the culture
blue cherry dress on you
is looking like a sculpture

this recreation is amusing
and confusing
you never knew that it
could feel so good while losing

what you lose?
your virginity

take off your glasses and fight

i'll be your domino
sit back and watch it flow
get so emotional
i got a notion for
and when a star gets bent
i'll be your parliament
i'll be your domino
sit back and watch it flow

my intuition was a
poppin' and a shakin'
the very thought of it was
all too much to take in

curl up with lover we
could lie out on the blanket
this canopy above i'll
take the time to thank it

take off your panties and fight

i'll be your domino
sit back and watch it flow
get so emotional
i got a notion for
and when a star gets bent
i'll be your parliament
i'll be your domino
sit back and watch it flow

i want to bury my face
deep in your aroma
her name is lisa
but they call her desdemona

come out and see me for
some street communication
i think it's sweet of you
to be my motivation

i'll be your domino
sit back and watch it flow
get so emotional
i got a notion for
and when a star gets bent
i'll be your parliament
i'll be your domino
sit back and watch it flow


when i had you to myself
i didn't want you around
those pretty faces always seemed
to stand out in a crowd
but someone picked you from the bunch
one look was all it took
and now it's much too late for me
to take a second look

oh baby, give me one more chance to
show you i love you
won't you please let me
back in your heart
oh darlin', i was blind to let you go
let you go baby
now since i've been true where it's at
i want you back!


burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch
burn it up, no need to reconcile

come and see me, i'm your west end perfect stranger, in america
lady on that state's so full of style

stand up, turn around, beat it out
you gotta sound, joe
swing low and now i know
it's hard to let a brother go, joe

no one said that you would need a crowd

the many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
and now i only see your face in clouds

stand up, turn around, beat it out
you gotta sound, joe
swing low and now i know
it's hard to let a brother go, joe

stand up, turn around, beat it out
you gotta sound, joe
swing low and now i know
it's hard to let a brother go, joe

do you know
does it show
when i'm low

and then again, when i feel your love from far away, i think of yesterday
i see a family we know how to smile

there comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along
there comes a time when we will walk that mile

stand up, turn around, beat it out
you gotta sound, joe
swing low and now i know
it's hard to let a brother go, joe

stand up, turn around, beat it out
you gotta sound, joe
swing low and now i know
it's hard to let a brother go, joe


on the corner into my car
i drive forever never get far
the 45 is slowly getting loaded
i send another song to my star

california mountains in the mornin'
stitch it up, and get it all
all along the woman's got a want it
stitch it up, and get it all
we all walk your pavement, get it off
take more than your...

whoa whoa, whoa whoa

a pendulum inside of my bed
swingin' low, i hope to get hit
the overflow is slow, but not enough no
another drop will never fix it

california mountains in the mornin'
get along, and get it all
all along the woman's got a want it
stitch it up, and get it all
we all walk your pavement, get if off
take more than your friends

if i call you lately
i could be your man
i could be your greatness
if i call you lately
i could be your man

whoa whoa, whoa whoa

i shut it down the look in my eyes
knock 'em dead a' covered in flies
the big sleep without a bed of roses
the light of day will never tell lies

all along the woman's got a want it
stitch it up, and get it all
california mountains in the mornin'
stitch it up, and get it all
we all walk your pavement
take more than your friends

if i call you lately
i could be your man
i could be your greatness
if i call you lately
i could be your man

on the river into my dock
i paddle thought the shadow and fog
to ponder all of those who came before me
another piece for building my arch


let's make evil
let's make good
i'd do anything i could
just to get you in my dirty wood
go down on you

seventeen and thirty-one
i am just my mother's son
brown eyes and a silver tongue
all the mothers come undone
at the sight of me

the water's falling clear
interiors deceive i fear
i think i'll kiss my shame away
my prudence is not dear
inside out and feeling weird
i think i'll kiss my shame away

let's get soft
let's get hard
let's get off in my backyard
where the desert wind
will wash our skin
a lighter red

let's make peace
let's make war
let's break into heaven for
a dance with heaven's devils or
is that more than you can store
inside your head

the water's falling clear
interiors deceive i fear
i think i'll kiss my shame away
my prudence is not dear
inside out and feeling weird
i think i'll kiss my shame away

i don't want to live alone
get on my throne
slay my shame
slay my shame

let's get gentle
let's get pissed
get your knickers in a twist
cause the angel and the devil kiss
they fell in love

some seem dirty
some stay clean
something from a madman's dream
am i really what i seem?
rising to my head like cream
it feels so strange

the water's falling clear
interiors deceive i fear
i think i'll kiss my shame away
my prudence is not dear
inside out and feeling weird
i think i'll kiss my shame away

slay my shame
slay my shame
i don't want to live alone
get on my throne
slay my shame
slay my shame


i will follow

i was on the outside
when you said, you said you needed me
and i was looking at myself
i was blind, i could not see

a boy tries hard to be a man
his mother takes him by his hand
if he stops to think, he starts to cry
oh, why?

if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
i will follow

i was on the inside
when they pulled the four walls down
i was looking through the window
i was lost, i am found

walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
i will follow

your eyes make a circle
i see you when i go in there
your eyes
your, your, your eyes
your eyes, just give it to me
just give up your eyes
oh

if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
i will follow
i will follow
i will follow
i will follow

i look into his eyes
they're closed but i see something.
a teacher told me why
i laugh when old men cry.

my body grows and grows
it frightens me, you know
the old man tried to walk me home
i thought he should have known.

twilight, lost my way
twilight, can't find my way.

in the shadow, boy meets man
in the shadow, boy meets man
in the shadow, boy meets man
in the shadow, boy meets man.

i'm running in the rain
it's all, it's everything
i'm soaking through the skin.

twilight, darkened day
twilight, lost my way
twilight, can't find my way.
can't find your way
can't find my way
can't find your way.

twilight, darkened day
twilight, lost my way
twilight, can't find my way.

in the shadow, boy meets man
in the shadow, boy meets man
in the shadow, boy meets man
in the shadow, boy meets man.


she waits for me to turn out the light
really still
she waits to break my will.


yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, yo-ho-ho.
yes, and i know the truth about you.
she cat.

and in the daylight
a blackbird makes a violent sight
and when she is done
she sleeps beside the one


yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, yo-ho-ho.
yes, and i know the truth about you
she cat.

yes, and i know the truth about you
she cat.


into the heart of a child
i stay awhile
but i can go there.

into the heart of a child
i can smile
i can go there.

into the heart, into the heart of a child
i can go back
i can stay awhile.
i can look straight
into the heart.

into the heart.


monday morning
eighteen years dawning
i said how long
you say how long

it was one dull morning
i woke the world with bawling
i was so sad
they were so glad

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control

boys and girls
go to school
and girls
they make children
not like this one

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control

i fought fate
there's blood at the garden gate
the man said childhood
it's in his childhood

one day i'll die
the choice will not be mine
will it be too late?
you can't fight fate

i was of the feeling it was out of control
i had the opinion that it was out of control


there's a place i go
when i am far away
there's a tv show
and i can go

sometimes the hero takes me
sometimes i don't let go
oh, oh, oh

there's a picture book
with colour photographs
there's a comic strip
that makes me laugh

sometimes the lady takes me
sometimes i don't let go

stories for boys
stories for boys
stories for boys
stories for boys
stories for boys

there's a place i go
and it's a part of me
there's a radio
and i will go

sometimes the hero takes me
sometimes i don't let go

stories for boys


a picture in grey
dorian gray
just me by the sea.

and i felt like a star
i felt the world could go far
if they listened to what i said.
just me, my ego by the sea.

it washes my feet
it washes my feet
splashes the soles of my shoes.


started a landslide in my ego
looked from the outside to the world i left behind.
i'm dreaming, you're awake
if i wasn't sleeping, what's at stake?

a day without me.

whatever the feelings, i keep feeling
what are the feelings you left behind?

a day without me.

started a landslide in my ego
looked from the outside to the world i left behind.
in the world i left behind
wipe their eyes and then let go
in the world i left behind
they shed a tear and on they go.


bright morning lights
wipe the sleep
from another day's eye.
turn away from the wall
and there's nothing at all.
being naked and afraid
in the open space of my bed.

i'll be with you now
i'll be with you now
i'll be with you now
we lie on a cloud, we lie.

just as i am
i awoke with a tear on my tongue
i awoke with a feeling of never before
in my sleep, i discovered the one
but she was gone with the morning sun.

i'll be with you now
i'll be with you now
i'll be with you now
we lie on a cloud, we lie.

another time, another place
we lie.
another time, another place.
we lie.
another time, another place
we lie.
your time, your place.


boy, stupid boy
don't sit at the table
until you're able to.

toy, broken toy
you can shout and shout, 'til you're inside out
but if you don't know.
electric co.
if you don't know
electric co.

red, running red
you play for real
but the toy can feel
holding your head
you won't shout
you still beg
if you don't know
the electric co.

if you don't know.
electric co.
if you don't know
electric co.


walls of white protest
a gravestone in name
who is it now?
it's always the same.

who is it now? who calls me inside?
are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
i walk the street rain tragicomedy
i'll walk home again to the street melody.

but i know, oh no
but i know, oh no
but i know.

shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees.

life through a window
a discoloured pain
mrs brown's washing is always the same
i walk the street rain tragicomedy
i'll walk home again to the street melody.

but i know, oh no
but i know, oh no
but i know.

do you feel in me
anything redeeming
any worthwhile feeling?
this love is like a tightrope
hanging from my ceiling?

but i know, oh no
but i know, oh no
but i know.

shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees
shadows and tall trees.

shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows and tall trees.

shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows, shadows, shadows.
shadows and tall trees.


into the heart of a child
i stay awhile
but i can go there

into the heart of a child
i can smile
i can't go there

into the heart, into the heart of a child
i can't go back
i can't stay awhile
into the heart

into the heart

it's cold outside
it gets so hot in here
and the boys and girls collide
to the music in my ear

hear the children crying
and i know it's time to go
i hear the children crying
take me home

a painted face
and i know we haven't long
we thought that we had the answers
it was the questions we had wrong

hear the children crying
and i know it's time to go
i hear the children crying
take me home

thank you
don't mention it
i'm pleased to meet you
don't think i'm very good at this
let me show

i don't wanna know

f-f-falling... the world is by your side
falling... did you find a place to hide

i just wanna know
i just wanna go

t-t-touching you
t-t-touching you
t-t-touching you

she said, the twenty second floor
but i said, i can't think what it's for

i just wanna know

gonna push it, wish they got it right
what they call you when you're in life
ran for an ocean, they running's done
running for a lady at the speed of life
of life

my question, at least you got it right
they got you when you're in sight
running from the ocean on stepping stones
running from a lady at the speed of life
of life

on your way inside a mirror turning in here, in his hand
love's still well if father keeps me home, it really is
i am higher, way up, fall


they stood on his shadow, they always do
all he wanted to spoil the view
of people and places, second-hand faces
he saw but never knew

oh, oh, oh, oh

she looked like a painting, a picture of you
depending on your point of view
she laughed with the others, they call out her name
she smiled, she said
goodbye

oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh


they met at a streetlight though she never knew
all he wanted was to spoil the view
and just for a second, it felt like a year
he waited for her second tear

oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh...


can you soar any higher, if you can't let go?
to save her in the fire, she won't say no

oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh...

it's a cartoon world
it's a cartoon world

uncle tony hates a drag
he didn't give me a lot of time, dear
jack and jill go up the hill
to pick some flowers and daffodils

it's a cartoon world
it's a cartoon world
it's a cartoon world
it's a cartoon world
it's a cartoon world
it's a cartoon


i try to sing this song
i, i try to stand up
but i can't find my feet
i try, i try to speak up
but only in you i'm complete

gloria, in te domine
gloria, exultate
gloria
gloria
oh, lord, loosen my lips

i try to sing this song
i, i try to get in
but i can't find the door
the door is open
you're standing there, you let me in

gloria, in te domine
gloria, exultate
oh, lord, if i had anything, anything at all
i'd give it to you
i'd give it to you

gloria, gloria
gloria, gloria
gloria, gloria
gloria, gloria
gloria, gloria
gloria, gloria
gloria


julie says, john i'm getting nowhere
i wrote this letter, hope to get just someplace soon
i want to get up
when i wake up
when i get up
i fall down.

julie wake up, julie tell the story
you wrote the letter, said you were gonna get there someday
gonna walk in the sun
and the wind and the rain
never walk back again
i know you fall down
you're falling down
you fall down
you fall down.

julie say something, julie say you're sorry
you're gonna get better, you better not leave me here anyway
i want to get up
when you wake up
but when i get up
i fall down
i'm falling down
i fall down
i broke myself.

i fall, i fall down
i'm falling down
when you fall
i fall with you
and when you're falling down
is when i hit the ground.
i fall with you
i fall down.


i was talking, i was talking to myself
somebody else talk, talk, talking.
i couldn't hear a word, a word he said.

he was my brother
i said there was no other way out of here
got to get out, got to get out.

i was walking, i was walking into walls
and back again
i just keep walking
i walk up to a window to see myself

and my reflection
when i thought about it
my direction
going nowhere, going nowhere.

no-one, no-one is blinder
than he who will not see.
no-one, no-one is blinder
than me.

i was talking, i was talking in my sleep
i can't stop talk, talk, talking
i'm talking to you, it's up to you

be my brother
there is no other way out of here
be my brother
got to get out, got to get out
got to get out of here.


it's falling, it's falling
and outside a building comes tumbling down.
and inside a child on the ground
says he'd do it again

and what am i to do?
what in the world am i to say?
there's nothing else to do.
he says he'll change the world some day
i rejoice.

this morning i fell out of bed
when i woke up to what he had said
everything's crazy
but i'm too lazy to lie

and what am i to do?
just tell me what am i supposed to say?
i can't change the world
but i can change the world in me
rejoice
rejoice

and what am i to do?
just tell me what am i supposed to say?
i can't change the world
but i can change the world in me

i rejoice

rejoice
in the rest of the world


the wind of life and air from above smells of death.
angels sing of the end.
nothing you say and nothing you try can change time.
human race prepares to die...


slit my wrists, take away the pain
slit my throat, there's no one to blame
lost in the fields of confusion

away!

right?


i came here for something and i'm not turning back
strong in the mind, but you still hold my keys
keeping my fate deep within your threshold
petty inconvenience, but it means the world to me

you have the power
to set me free
caught in your grasp, how?
just let me be

give me control out
out of these depths
a fiery hell
i pray for death

i've been the wrong one time and time again
now i'm on my knees, forgive me please
tore out my heart and handed to me on a silver platter
sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion

you made me this way
i am the product of your creation
sew up the hole, right now,
now you turn the other way.

you've turned away from me,
the future's much too far away to see.
i hope you learn the truth,
not the way things were meant to be with me and you.


darkness coats us.
the smell of fall.
changing season.
the graveyard is alive, black cat across my path,
the chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.
imprisoned souls.
trapped for eternity.
black crows break the silence.
just enjoy it.
open up your mind and you will feel it too.
the sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
you can feel the thoughts of the dead.
feeling the thoughts of the dead.
true or false, it's still there, teaching me.
true or false, still there, teaching me.
the wood has rotted away.
take the time absorb it.
their time is slipping away.
stone all carved by hand.
statues that resemble their faces.
they still breathe.
come join us.

smell the burning embers, time flickering away.
timeless but soon gone.
timeless but soon gone.

and i can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.
as time crumbles away.
time crumbles away.

timeless but soon gone.
timeless but soon gone.
and i can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.
as time crumbles away.
time crumbles away.


the endless torture.
the painless pleasure.
i grasp myself.
trying to regain control.
i experience and learn.
in another faction of my mind.
so confused.
but everything makes perfect sense.
can't feel the pain.
emotional pain's so much deadlier.
pain. your friends can't help you.
why won't they help you? another reality.
this can't be happening.
why is this happening?
trying hard to figure out what's done.
i scramble but now i run.
the images in my head.
all the problems that i've been fed.
all the problems that i've been fed.
punching slowly my mind can't change the speed.
as my victims bleed.
no matter what i do or how hard i try.
i can't use my abilities.
use my abilities.
art of illusion.
my razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.
but i can not take their soul.
punching through jello, stabbing not killing.
disappointment. discomfort.
my razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.
but i can't take their soul.
punching through jello, stabbing not killing.
disappointment. discomfort.


black and gray clouds willow in the balance as the sun falls.
rain plays a heart warming tune, on the pavement.
emotions stir.
a feeling of warmness, compassion, i feel at home.
disguised by surroundings.
as the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance on their mistreated lives.
as the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.
as the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.
a silhouette stands still.
but the rain falls cold and the moon shines bright.
cold as ice.
warm as home.
ready to live.
stars they shoot.
in a clear.
across the sky.
as does my time.
waiting, wanting, feeling, emotion.
crying, breaking, loving, nothing.

clouds swallow the moon, and i'm alone, thinking good times, and why'd they go?

falling down, breaking down parts of me.
falling down, breaking down parts of me.

clouds swallow the moon, and i'm alone, thinking good times, and why'd they go?


the mark i breathe on you.
it's burning through your soul.
the breath i waste.
losing control.
i bleed in pain.
testing what i know.
lips soaked in deceit.
pull me from here.
no one's innocent.
so why do i feel bad?
guilt. tearing me up inside.
the innocent.
an evil in disguise.
the face of beauty to fall for.
i fall to my knees, deceitful.
brought down by feelings of regret.
again your mind has failed the test.
not everyone feels the same.
pacifist blinded by the game.
stand tall. they'll break your heart.
stand tall. they'll smash your ego.
stand tall. they'll tear you down.
stand tall. scar your soul.
break your thought.
the mark i breathe on you.
it's burning through your soul.
the breath i waste.
losing control.
i bleed in pain.
testing what i know.
lips soaked in deceit.
pull me from this hole.


your hazel green tint eyes watching every move i make.
and the feeling of doubt. it's erased.
i'll never feel alone again, with you by my side.
you're the one, and in you i confide.

and we have gone through good and bad times.
but your unconditional love, was always on my mind.
you've been there from the start for me.
and your love's always been, true as can be.
i'll give my heart to you.
i give my heart,
cause nothing can compare in this world to you.


so much time i've wasted.
i can truly say i never thought it would come to this.
never would i doubt you, but the truth kept smacking me in the face.
reality. you never stopped to think and you ripped us apart.
how could you? now our time is gone but it's still breaking my heart.
tears run down as i think of the days we've had, and the memories will last forever,
but you and i have died and gone our separate ways.
you are the one.
you are the wrong one.
breaking the mold.
going your own way.
all i feel, betrayal.


we had something great, then it was washed away.
we had something more, then i can explain.
i'm sorry. no! we had something great, then it was washed away.
no! not all friendships last, the genuine are harder to take.
no! time to start again, hope someday you'll think of me.
no! the end reality, i know someday i'll think of you.


when you see them coming in form.
and they say they do what's best for you.
fighting for one total control.
they are planned and organized for you.
breaking their hold. breaking their hold of control they strive.
to keep you down, behind your back, the time has come, the end is near.
it's not to help you, but help their cause, under one system, you won't exist.
they are the few, with all the power,
our system screams, we can't let them tear our hearts out.
screaming, pulling on our pride.
stand together for the right cause, one system to our demise.


forgotten faces.
lost in yesterdays realm.
drained with confusion.
where did it all go?
look into the past, look into their faces.
but now they're all gone and all that's left is this blank faced picture.
ninety percent, nothing was done, nothing accomplished,
coasting through life didn't seize the day.
no one ever realized that they're already dead.
by the time you realize, you'll be dead too.
without another chance to save the world,
these things they're gone, you're gone, forgotten.


it's gone, forever.
right before my very eyes.
and just when i thought i made light of things.
it slips away, into darkness.
my life passes now i see.
just what this world does hold for me.
it's getting hard, harder to breathe.
am i out of time is that what this means?
well that's what it means.
that's what it means, you and me try to breathe.
now you. realize.
your life, flies by.
now i. realize.
my life, i die.


i don't want to know.
and i don't want to see you in this place.
your kind is a disgrace as i spit in your face.
and i don't want to hear anymore.
come on you kids, stand your ground.
this is your show, it's your family.
all of my friends there for me.

there's four-hundred more of us then them.
so kick them out.
keep it positive.
keep it real.
keep it true.
together with my friends.
i'll be there for you.

through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
this is to my brothers, i'll be there for you.
through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
this is to my family.
i'll be there for you.

i don't want to know.
and i don't want to see you in this place.
your kind is a disgrace as i spit in your face.
and i don't want to hear anymore.


you live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.
you never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
there seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.
the ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live.
one groups taught how and the other group is taught why.
there's no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life i'm doing fine.
no reason to tell you which way to be.
cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life i'm doing fine.
no reason to tell you which way to be.
cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
look what's happening now.
what are the reasons why and how?
and don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated different 'cause they're not the same as me or you?
you live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.

i see you fading away from us.
i'll miss you very much.
room with empty bottles, broken dreams, and pride still running high, always on your side.
but i wanted more for you.
you can't go on this way.
and now i see it all fall through.
we pray for better days.
stuck alone and scared.
throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.
i don't want to see you like this.
we all tried to save you but missed.
i still feel the hope on your road.
now come back to us like the days of the old.
i still feel you there, trying to get on top.
you'll always have my support, in my heart.
people you've hurt.
friends that you've lied to.
i can see it too, for you, i'm scared, if i lose you, i'm not prepared.
this time, if you die.
i watch you, right before my eyes.
just trust me, and listen.
you have no self control.
this will take your life.

overdose and then indulge until you die.
pondering, we all ask the question why.
broken home, and then abandoned by your dad.
and we are left the only family that you've ever had.

i wanted more for you.
you can't go on this way.
and now i see it all fall through.
we pray for better days.
stuck alone and scared.
throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.

help you see it through.
fight this me and you.
reaching deep inside.
problems not just you is what we find.
our friendship makes it mine.


fallen souls we shine so bright

rise now and ever
we command you
rise now and ever
we command you

no one can touch us


i'll try, she said, as she walked away
try not to lose you
two vibrant hearts could change
nothing tears the being more than deception
unmasked fear
i'll be here waiting tested and secure

nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sin's deep in my blood
you'll be the one to fall

i wish i could be the one
the one who won't care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go, no one's guiding me

when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know it's hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know it's hurting you, but it's killing me

nothing will last in this life
our time is spent constructing
now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin

constrict your hands around me
squeeze till i cannot breathe
this air tastes dead inside me
contribute to our plague

break all your promises
tear down this steadfast wall
restraints are useless here
tasting salvation's near

nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sin's deep in my blood
you'll be the one to fall

i wish i could be the one
the one who won't care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go, no one's guiding me

when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know it's hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know it's hurting you, but it's killing me


blood is spilt and man will follow
infernal man, punishment too great to bear)
conceived and born was one of light

raise your head and taste the courage
i've come here to kill you
won't leave until you've died
murder born of vengeance

and from my hands to my brother's grave
you took his side, you took his gift
feel the power of a fallen man, crestfallen man...

far away in this land i must go
out of the sight of the one
a punishment sent from his hand
a hardship no one should know
now go out of the sight of the one
away in this land you must go

where has he gone? what have you done?
a voice commands from high above this earth
from the soil his blood cries out to me
murder, liar, vengeance, deceit


with this ink in our skin we've sealed our fate,
and the axe comes early
there's a bed of skeletons waiting for me,
on the other side
human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog
belief, structure built up in you.
i'll tear you down and the one who created you

if they didn't have one how would they act?
if we didn't have hope how would we behave?
would they still feel remorse
if they slaughtered innocent beings?
or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?

a good friend once told me you are memory
without it we equal nothing
and all i can see is the place i wanna be
suddenly my life was so free
leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
but keep away from me... keep away from me


we may have created the beginning, mentally
we may have created the beginning, physically
to the end of our human existence...

i see through you
the fear that's in your eyes

a good friend once told me you are memory
without them we equal nothing
all i can see is the place i wanna be
timeless my life was so free
leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
i don't know the answers but neither do you.


hard news, taken harder, don't look to me
disappointed, we don't agree, i don't need your praise...
from the beginning you came to me)
never asked you to like me,
look down on me, spit in my face,
you're nothing to me... not to me

darkened eyes you'll see,
there is no hope, no savior in me
"don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
learned from years gone by, no one will care,
what happens to me
"don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)

my presence won't be ignored, no not today
don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
from the beginning you came to me)
asking questions, predetermined answers,
and i don't want you. i won't let you think,
compromise is near, 'cause it's not near.

darkened eyes you'll see,
there is no hope, no savior in me
"don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
learned from years gone by, no one will care,
what happens to me
"don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)

i'm alone in here
no more feelings
killed my fears
don't ask
you'll never know
you're left behind and i'll be exposed

far away, you keep on trying...
holding me down, breaking away,
trying to distance my life.
not one in the crowd, but one with the answer
the one that could change your mind

but it's not true, i don't need you
don't waste your time, and don't waste mine
i'm not your friend, i won't soothe your soul
and in the end you're all dead to me...


black enchanting eyes,
cut through my heart
with no regret or sign of life
they tear apart my pride
and cold runs through my veins
i feel their stare from miles, haunting every step
and they won't stop hunting me down
i know the time will come,
when all around me's burned
and you'll still see me there
asking where you went to
and what person brought you here
and why you left the burning children
and calling for you all alone...

dark in their hearts,
i can feel it burn inside of me
tormented young with no souls, haunting me
pain in their lives all they know is misery
take these chains away that are holding me down

they'll find you alone,
and your desperate and villainous ways
turning their hearts into stone
they seek more then vengeance
look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
burn for the rest of time


dark in their hearts,
i can feel it burn inside of me
tormented young with no souls, haunting me
pain in their lives all they know is misery
take these chains away that are holding me down

eternal rest... in time
eternal rest... in time


we keep writing talking and planning,
but everything is changing.
we all know what to do but no one does it.
now this time has passed and full of regret.
two in my heart have left me a while, i stand alone.
when they get back, it won't be the same

my life, you've always been there.
now you're gone and my head's spinning.
left the childhood, left the memories,
left the good times in the past.
moving on... your time has run out.
wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait.
wasting away once again, once lived as friends.

as time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life.

never will i forget you, and all the memories past.
so rarely i get to see your face.
growing i looked to you in guidance.
we knew that time would kill us,
but you're still so close to me.

to me you were my life.
to me you were my soul companion.
now you are so far away.
nothing can take away the time and the memories we had.
come back - to the days when we were young,
come back - to the days when nothing mattered.
to the days when nothing mattered

and i feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,

as time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,


a bullet sunk straight through my skull
a friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
no pain as i awake, but dead
seeing the face of the man
the time as he lays down his gun
i knew this was going to take place
white silence, so peaceful, so numb

no one knows the time they're changing
no one will see through...

i've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay
moving on seemed to be somber bliss
without one goodbye
i watch my mother shed tears

no... this gun has stopped time in it's tracks
has altered the course of my fate
destiny is shattered and timeless
closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace

i'll watch you call, calling for me,
you can't bring back time...
close your eyes or look away,
fate exposed and won't let me stay
descending entity in me

my voice has been taken from me.
the more i listen, the more i have to say.

i've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay
moving on seemed to be somber bliss
without one goodbye
i watch my mother shed tears
and taste the blood she cries)

i'll watch you call, calling for me,
you can't bring back time...
close your eyes or look away,
fate exposed and won't let me stay
descending entity in me


cry alone, i've gone away
i've gone alone, took all my strength
i've made the change,

sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and loved

building up inside of me
a place so dark, so cold, i had to set me free
don't mourn for me,
you're not the one to place the blame

sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and most of all i loved
but i can't see myself that way
please don't forget me or cry while i'm away

cry alone, i've gone away
i've gone alone, took all my strength
but i've made the change,

so far away, i'm gone.
and while i'm gone everything will be alright

no more breath inside
no more breath inside


come back to me, this is unconceivable
breaking apart the ones you love
hate runs deep for what you've done to us
left alone through suicide... suicide

i just want to die, take away my life
lay by your side, please...

come back to me, this is unconceivable
breaking apart the ones you love
hate runs deep for what you've done to us
left alone through suicide...

look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
no dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
he's gone. nothing will take back time.
i need him back, but nothing will take back time.

i can see just fine, with you in my life,
there by my side as it starts to fade
i know this can't be right, stuck in a dream

i look back and see the twisted road
best friends and despair took its toll
take away... take away... take away... take away

sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me, i care for
and most of all i loved
but i can't see myself that way
please don't forget me
or cry while i'm away

look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
no dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
he's gone. nothing will take back time.
i need him back, but nothing will take back time.

i can see just fine, with you in my life,
there by my side as it starts to fade
i know this can't be right, stuck in a dream


dust begins to fall, to the ground
the air is cold and thin
thoughts are haunting me as i look around
this will never end, when i'll bleed forever

don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
this spot in hell's where i belong
i've come so far, it's been so long
don't know why it started or where it came from

outside shell is strong, confident
but slowly eats away
like a man plagued with disease, i try to fight
through my pores it seems to seep
when i'll bleed forever

don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
this spot in hell's where i belong
i've come so far, it's been so long
don't know why it started or where it came from

and why you sit there and do nothing
you're content with doing nothing

there's nowhere to run and hide
when you're living to die
stuck alone inside your head
better off dead
the phone would ring in the empty house
no one's around

don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
this spot in hell's where i belong
i've come so far, it's been so long
don't know why it started or where it came from

but in my life, i wanted more, i needed more
i taste... more!


lived through you,
safe with how we lived our lives,
with how it all turned out.
uncovered lies, surfaced throughout,
will make you change your mind

sometimes life is altered
won't turn out right. can't turn out right

when i see you, i can read it in your eyes,
fate misunderstood.
swallowed the lies, can't blame you for,
thinking with your heart.

sometimes life is altered.
break from the ropes your hands are tied.
uneasy with confrontation.
won't turn out right. can't turn out right

i see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
i know, i know.
dark will turn to light, in time i'll be all right
i know, i know
so cold so black so alone)

living goes by fast, catch your breath
and it will pass you by.
and it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold.

sometimes life is altered.
break from the ropes your hands are tied.
uneasy with confrontation.
won't turn out right. can't turn out right.

sometimes life is altered.
break from the ropes your hands are tied.
won't turn out right. can't turn out right.


this shining city built of gold
a far cry from innocence
there's more than meets the eye
'round here look to the waters of the deep
a city of evil

there sat a seven-headed beast
ten horns raised from his head
symbolic woman sits on his throne
but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
the beast and the harlot

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

the city dressed in jewels and gold
fine linen, myrrh and pearls
her plagues will come all at once
as her mourners watch her burn
destroyed in an hour

merchants and captains of the world
sailors, navigators too
will weep and mourn this loss
with her sins piled to the sky
the beast and the harlot

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

the day has come for all us sinners
if you're not a servant you'll be struck to the ground
flee the burning, greedy city
looking back on her to see there's nothin' around

i don't believe in fairytales and no one wants to go to hell
you've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
you're welcome to the city where your future is set
forever

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

she's a dwelling place for demons
she's a cage for every unclean spirit
every filthy bird and makes us drink
the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great


jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
converse behind my back, but now i'm here
need no one to comply with me though everyone that i defeat

hatred fuels my blood
one king to watch the horsemen fail
now i can understand
it's sorrow that feeds your lies
whoa, yeah!

you're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
a crutch for you that won't always be there
hide in the dark another day
the fear in you is here to stay

hatred fuels my blood
one king to watch the horsemen fail
now i can understand
put faith in you for the last time
it's sorrow that feeds your lies
ha! yeah, yeah!

sweet child we'll miss you
no, so far away, far away

now i can understand
put faith in you for the last time
it's sorrow that feeds your lies

falling away
can't buy back time
burn it down anyways


i don't know where to begin, but i'll start with the radical leaders
their steps we're followin'

running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
everyone eventually will take the step 'cause it's in sight you take the left i'll take the right i feel the hate you've built
for me and i say pay attention baby)

as they thank the lord the blind can't see
like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

but it wasn't a sin, a sorry life in judging every action
how to speak how to ask all the questions

push you on the story of immortal father mortal son give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)
don't give them all the power when your future's in desperate trouble baby

as they thank the lord the blind can't see
like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
running away from condition, i see you but you're running away from
you're scared seductive system

most would claim i live a lie when pointing out it's easy to predict these things
every color has its side, they live together vote and most won't read between these lines
please help us, please save us of course they have control we're all the same
up on the cross, crucified their problem drove the nail and let him rot
family and friends, it won't matter in the end i'm sure they'll understand
now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
as i sit up here and wonder bout how you sold your mind, body and soul
looking at the fields so green i know this sounds obscene
i see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty

as they thank the lord the blind can't see
like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to run

you've fallen asleep here in denial
look at the way we're dyin'
how it ends i'll never know
just live your life blind like me


caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
the heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
no oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me

too many doses and i'm starting to get an attraction
no one can save me and you know i don't want the attention

as i adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
my hand is on the trigger i'm ready to ignite
tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right
mental fiction, follow me; show me what it's like to be set free

too many doses and i'm starting to get an attraction
no one can save me and you know i don't want the attention

so sorry you're not here i've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
these eyes won't see the same, after i flip today

sometimes i don't know why we'd rather live than die
we look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
we may get some solutions but most just pass us by
don't want your absolution 'cause i can't make it right
i'll make a beast out of myself, gets rid of all the pain of being a man

too many doses and i'm starting to get an attraction
no one can save me and you know i don't want the attention

so sorry you're not here i've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
i've known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apart
scared but you can follow me i'm too weird to live but much too rare to die


our lives on hold)

trashed and scattered again, i'm feelin' so low
my destination is always unknown, i'll find my way there

i won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
and don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
don't try to judge or take shots at me, i'll never let you seize control


right there)


trashed and scattered again, i'm feelin' so low
my destination is always unknown, i'll find my way there
but goddamn impostor are you out of your mind?

i walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here


i won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
and don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
don't try to judge or take shots at me, i'll never let you seize control

i feel your world keep dying, no more use in tryin'
and my body's trashed and low, but to you i'll never show myself or what's inside
and i've seen it all before but i'll settle the score, i'll never join your side


oh lord
and i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord
oh lord, oh lord

well, if you told me you were drowning
i would not lend a hand
i've seen your face before, my friend
but i don't know if you know who i am

well, i was there and i saw what you did
i saw it with my own two eyes
so you can wipe off that grin, i know where you've been
it's all been a pack of lies

oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord
oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord, oh lord

well, i remember
i remember, don't worry
how could i ever forget?
it's the first time, the last time we ever met

but i know the reason why you keep this silence up
no, you don't fool me
the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
it's no stranger to you and me

oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord
oh lord, oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord

oh lord
and i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord
oh lord, oh lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord, oh lord
oh lord, oh lord, oh lord, lord
well, i've been waiting for this moment for all my life
oh lord, oh lord


it must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love
oh this must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love

well i wait in every day, just in case,
you decide to call
and i can hardly wait, 'cause i never thought time could pass so slowly

it must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love
oh this must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love

happiness is something i never thought i'd feel again, but now i know
it's you that i've been looking for
and day by day more and more
i know what you think, you've heard it before
don't tell me i know
but this feeling inside my heart,
you know i'm never letting go
'cause i think that...

it must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love
oh this must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love

words can only say so much
it's hard to express
the things you do to me
you're everything i could ever dreamed you'd be

this must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love
oh this must be love, i'm feeling
this must be love...


i held the book so tightly in my hands,
i saw your picture, heard you call my name
it was strange i could not look away
i had to be there, i wanted to go

you gave me no reason
you gave me no warning
but i was with you,
by your side
give me the strength, so i can help you
and i can be strong now, they don't frighten me

it's written in the book

the sun is hotter than before
but inside it's cold, i wonder why
but if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
well i believe we can make it right

it's time now
to show our feelings
looking through you


your heart's empty
whatever happened to you, you can't change it,
nowhere to run to, please, oh please don't let me down

but wait a minute i don't understand
it's getting stronger, hold my hand
don't want to leave you i don't want to go
but i'm a' losing all control
can't you see me i'm slipping away
i can only stay if you've the will to keep me here
oh lord

it's written in the book

i held the book so tightly in my hands
saw your picture, heard you call my name
oh, and even though we never, never touched
i keep waiting for you just the same

la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la la...


the roof is leaking and the wind is howling
kids are crying 'cause the sheets are so cold
i woke this morning found my hands were frozen
i've tried to fix the fire, but you know the damn thing's too old

it's been months now, since we heard from our mary,
i wonder if she ever made the coast
she and her young man, they both moved out there
but i sure hope they write, just to let us know

and me, i'm getting stronger by the minute
my wife's expecting, but i hope she can wait
'cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
but spring'll soon be here,
oh god i hope it's not late

ma and pa lived here, and theirs before them

tried their hardest to make it a home
seems so long now since they passed over
hope my children'll try to make it their own

the roof is leaking and the wind is howling
kids are crying, 'cause the sheets are so cold
i woke this morning found my hands were frozen
i've tried to fix the fire, but you know the damn thing's too old

and me, i'm getting stronger by the minute
my wife's expecting, but i hope she can wait
'cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
but spring'll soon be here,
oh god i hope it's not late


so you finally came right out and said it girl
what took you so long
it was in your eyes, that look's been there for too long
i'm waiting in line
would you say if i was wasting my time

or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh

i think about it from time to time
when i'm lonely and on my own

i try to forget and yet, still rush to the telephone
i'm waiting in line
would you say if i was wasting my time

or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh
or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh

well it feels like something you want so bad
then you think you've got it, but it's something you already had
you can feel it all around you, but it's something you just can't touch
and i feel it coming at me
i can feel it coming at me

or did i miss again
i think i missed again oh
or did i miss again
i think i missed again

i'm waiting in line, but would you say if i was wasting my time

or did i miss again...


just as i thought i'd make it
you walk back into my life
just like you never left

just as i'd learned to be lonely
you call up to tell me
you're not sure if you're ready
but ready or not, you'll take what you've got and leave

leave me alone with my heart
i'm putting the pieces back together again
just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
i can do without you, know what i mean...

i wish i could write a love song,
to show you the way i feel
seems you don't like to listen
oh but like it or not, take what you've got and leave

leave me alone with my heart
it's broken in two and i'm not thinking too straight
just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
you've taken everything else, you know what i mean


i never thought i'd ever get tired of playing games
but i've been holding back for too long
now the time has come to get it right
now's the time to show them all that they're wrong

'cause they said thunder and they said lightning
it would never strike twice
oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
how come this feels so nice, oh it feels all right

never ever did believe in guiding lights
'cause what you didn't hold, slipped away
oh but there's a feeling deep down in my shoe
'cause things look like they're going my way

'cause they say thunder and they say lightning
it would never strike twice
oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
how come this feels so nice, oh it feels all right

i never ever did believe in a second chance
you get, just one crack of the whip, that's all
if you played the game, you got treated right
oh but i'm not playing the game, no more

'cause they say thunder and they say lightning
it would never strike twice
oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
how come this feels so nice, oh it feels all right


if you feel it do it,
you don't need a reason
for all you know it could be good for you

to show your feelings
don't just leave them
do the things you believe in, it's all right
don't worry turn around, i will still be here

i'm not moving... no really
you just try and push me out
no, i'm not moving... no really

if you think it, say it
'cause no one will stop you
don't keep quiet, just 'cause you think you ought to
feel free to shout it loud, speak your mind, spit it out

'cause i'm not moving... no really
you just try and push me out
no i'm not moving i can sit it out
no really, there's no hurry
so don't worry turn around, i will still be here

if it hurts don't do it
'cause no one can take you make you drink
and no one can tell you what you think
remember if your spirit starts to sink
don't worry turn around, i will still be here


i read all the letters...
i read each word that you've sent to me
and though its past now, and your words...
all the memories i've had, still remain

i've kept all the pictures, but i hide my feelings so no one knows
oh sure my friends all come 'round,
but i'm in a crowd, and own my own
it's 'cause you're gone now, but your heart... heart still remains
and it'll be here if you come again

you see i'd heard the rumours
i knew before you let me know
but i didn't believe it, not you
no, you would not let me go

seems i was wrong,
but i love, love you the same
and that's the one thing that you can't take away

but just remember...

if leaving me is easy,
then you know, coming back is harder
if leaving me is easy,
then you know, coming back is harder

hoh...


turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
it is not dying, it is not dying
lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
it is shining, oh it is shining
that you may see the meaning of within
it is beginning, oh it is beginning

that love is all and love is ev'ryone
it is knowing, oh it is knowing
and ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
it is believing, oh it is believing
so play the game, existence to the end
of the beginning, of the beginning

of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning
of the beginning, of the beginning

somewhere over the rainbow
way up high
there's a land that i dreamed of, once in a lullaby


well, you can tell ev'ryone i'm a down disgrace

you won't catch me crying 'cause i just can't win
i don't care anymore
i don't care anymore

i don't care what you say
i don't play the same games you play

'cause i've been talking to the people that you call your friends
and it seems to me there's a means to and end
they don't care anymore
and as for me i can sit here and bide my time
i got nothing to lose if i speak my mind
i don't care anymore i don't care no more

i don't care what you say

i won't be there anymore

'cause ev'ry day i'm feeling fine with myself
and i don't care now what you say
hey i'll do all right by myself
'cause i know

'cause i remember all the times i tried so hard
and you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
i don't care anymore.
and i really ain't bothered what you think of me
'cause all i want of you is just a let me be
i don't care anymore

when i opened your letter yesterday
i could not believe my eyes
'cause i've already given all i have to give
and i think it must have slipped your mind
but i remember not so long ago
i gave it all, it's gone
and i gave it all to you
now i'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

oh, d'you hear me?
i cannot believe it's true
are you really doing the things you do?
no i cannot believe it's you, really you

oh these people i'm talking to don't understand
they don't seem to realize
they're listening, but they're not hearing me
they're being too cruel to be kind
any kind of feeling that i had is gone
'cause i gave it all, it's gone
and i gave it all to you
now i'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

oh, d'you hear me?
i cannot believe it's true
are you really doing the things you do?
no i cannot believe it's you, really you

over and over i keep on telling myself
over and over i hope i'm gonna wake up
over and over i know it's really happening
and there's nothing that i can say
'cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me
nothing can make me stay

oh, 'cause you know i cannot believe it's true
are you really doing the things you do
no i cannot believe it's you, really you

i know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
it seems all so well laid out but i cannot get through
never meant it to show
it started happening, that's all you know.

oh, i gave it all to you
now i'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

oh, d'you hear me?
i cannot believe it's true
are you really doing the things you do?
no i cannot believe it's you, really you

over and over i keep on telling myself
over and over i hope i'm gonna make up
but over and over i know it's really happening
and there's nothing that i can say
'cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me
nothing can make me stay

'cause you know i cannot believe it's true
are you really doing the things you do
no i cannot believe it's you, really you

chorus to fade


my mom and dad both say
i must be crazy to be this infatuated
but i know you know
we got something special never felt before
you get me going just looking at you
and the feeling's not hard to recognise so
all right i'll come out in the open with it
will you walk out with me?

'cause you're the first girl i've ever loved
tell me do you feel the same way
well i'll show you i'm not like all the rest
'cause i know who i am

your skin is smooth as silk and your eyes like stars
you're just like a picture book standing there
but i can't go on
no, i can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way that i do

i'll be so careful i'll hold you like china
i'll promise not to hurt you i'll hold you like china
you won't feel nothing, i'll hold you like china
'cause i know it's your first time

your mum and dad don't like me
and they tell me every time i call around to see you
i don't know why
'cause i always straighten my tie and comb my hair
i know your brother thinks that
i'm a limp wristed wimp from the other side of town
i know he's got me wrong
because i'm really not like that, i'll tell you why

you're the first girl i've ever loved
tell me do you feel the same way
well i'll show you i'm not like all the rest
'cause i know who i am

i remember the very first time i held your hand
and that was the last time you were so close to me
but i can't go on
no, i can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way as i do

i'll be so careful i'll hold you like china
i'll promise not to hurt you i'll hold you like china
you won't feel nothing, i'll hold you like china
'cause i know it's your first time

i know you know and now i want to, i want to tell everybody
i know you know and now i want them all to see

repeat to fade


you said you would, you didn't and i wanna know why
and don't make no excuses
you promised, you promised, you better explain
though i don't know what the use is
you said you could, you couldn't, now why did you lie?
you made it look so easy
you did it, why do it, what was your point?
laughing while you tease me

oh, do you know and do you care?

i said i did, i shouldn't 'cause the magic will go
it happened once before
you'll see it, you'll steal it and take it away
and then come back for more
don't say you would, you wouldn't 'cause i saw you myself
it's too late for your reason
you're lying, you're lying, you've done it this time
i'm sick of all the cheating

oh, well do you know and do you care?

'cause i watch you
oh every day i watch you pass me by
i'll get you
yes in the end i'll get you
just watch me try

oh you make it hard to be hard but i'm trying my best
'cause down inside i'm burnin'
you want it, you got it, now take it and run
i'll hide how much it's hurtin'

oh, well do you know and do you care?
oh, well do you know and do you care?
oh, do you know, and do you care?


i need love, love to ease my mind
i need to find time
someone to call mine
but mama said

you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take
you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
just trust on my good times
no matter how long it takes

but how many heartaches must i stand
before i find a love to let me live again
right now the only thing
that keeps me hangin' on
when i feel my strength
ooh, it's almost gone
i remember mama said

you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take
how long must i wait
how much more can i take
before loneliness
will cause my heart, heart to break

now i can't bear to live my life alone
i grow impatient for a love to call my own
but when i feel that i, i can't go on
well these precious words keep me hangin' on
i remember mama said

you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take
you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
just trust on my good times
no matter how long it takes

no love, love don't come easy
but i keep on waitin'
anticipating for that soft voice
for some tender arms
to hold me tight
i keep waiting
keep on waitin'
until that day
but it ain't easy yeah
it ain't easy
but mama said

you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take

you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take

you can't hurry love
no, you'll just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take


well it don't matter to me what you say, what you say
and it don't matter to me what you're doing all right, all right.

because i've heard it all so many times before
just what you're saying and
i don't really want to hear it all no more, no more
don't wanna hear it no more

'cause there's no way that you can run
'cause i'm gonna find you
and there's nobody that you can turn to
'cause i'll be behind you just to remind you

that it don't matter to me what you say, what you say, say, say, saying
well it didn't matter to me what you're doing all right, all right

it seems to me it's been too easy for you for too long
so you'd better climb down before you fall and hurt your pride, your pride
you're gonna hurt your pride

'cause there' nowhere that you can run to
'cause i'm gonna find you
and there's no place that you can stay
'cause i'll be behind you just to remind you

that it don't matter to me what you do
well it don't matter to me, i'm talking to you, talking to you
well it don't matter to me believe me
well it don't matter to me

i can hear through these walls
i can hear it when they're foolin' around
i can hear through these walls and
i hear every sign, every sound
i can hear through these walls
in the dark with the shades pulled down
every word that they say
every move they make feels it's coming my way

my favorite moment, putting the glass up next to the wall
imagination, though i see nothing, i hear it all
putting my sign up, do not disturb me, speak or shout, inside out
oh, when my clothes, they're all laid out

i can see through my windows
i can see the girls and the boys
i can see through my windows and
i can imagine the noise
i can see through my windows
i can see them playing with toys
oh i hope it won't end
if i promise not to touch, just be a friend

life is so lonely and i don't get high off just being me
i like pretending wanting to touch them, wanting to see
it's only normal creeping behind you, now don't shout, 'cause it's alright
they keep the windows locked and the door shut tight

ooh i'm feeling like i'm locked in a cage no way in, no way out
and it gets so lonely am i really asking a lot
just to reach out and touch somebody?
'cause when i look through my windows or open my door

we know you really only wanna hear
the things we like to say
but if i said to you please don't do it
you do it anyway
sometimes i know, we gotta be cruel
be cruel to be kind
when i ask you, what you see in me
you say our love is blind

'cause only you know and i know
the things we mean to say
only you know and i know
the things we mean to say

whenever i think i know you better
better than i know myself
i open up and give you everything
then you say, o.k. what else
and when i run away you always cry
you always over react
but i don't know if you know how you really feel
but you better know before i get back

'cause only you know and i know
the things we mean to say
only you know and i know
the things we mean to say

just try to remember
now i'm the one you love

the things we mean to say
only you know and i know
the things we mean to say

only you know and i know
the things we mean to say, yes
only you know and i know
the things we mean to say

only you know and i know...


while i sit here trying to think of things to say
someone lies bleeding in a field somewhere
so it would seem we've still got a long long way to go
i've seen all i wanna see today

while i sit here trying to move you anyway i can
someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
and it would seem that we've still got a long long way to go
but i can't take it anymore

turn it off if you want to
switch it off it will go away
turn it off if you want to
switch it off or look away

while i sit and we talk and talk and we talk some more
someone's loved one's heart stops beating in a street somewhere
so it would seem we've still got a long long way to go, i know
i've heard all i wanna hear today


switch it off
turn it off


it's over, oh yes it's all over
and it's been a long time coming
some say it's too long
she said it, and now she'll regret it
but if she'd ask anyone
i know they'll tell her to her face, that it's too late

'cause i don't wanna know
no, i don't wanna know
she can cry all she wants
she's not gonna bring me back, no no
i don't wanna know
i don't wanna know
she can try all she wants
it's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no

they warned me
oh yes they all warned me
they told me now don't lose your heart to her
she'll never give it back, no no
oh it's too late
she made a big mistake
it wouldn't be the first one anyway
tell me how many more, no no no

she can cry all she wants
she's not gonna bring me back, no no
she can try all she wants
it's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no

i've been trying for so long, to let you know,
let you know how i feel
so if i stumble and if i fall, just help me back,
so i can make you see

'cause i can't wait forever

'cause i can't wait forever

i've been sitting here so long, just wasting time,
just staring at the phone
and always wondering, should i call you,
then i thought, but maybe you're not alone

'cause i can't wait forever

'cause i can't wait forever

'cause i can't wait forever

like a river to the sea,
i will always be with you
and if you sailed away
i would follow you

'cause i can't wait forever

i know there'll never be a time
you'll ever feel the same
and i know it's only words
but if you change your mind,
you know that i'll be here
and maybe we both can learn

'cause i can't wait forever

'cause i can't wait forever

and i know she knows it keeps me, well there ain't no other way
but she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'cause when i tell her that she'll miss me when i'm gone, she says
who said i would

she knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
she fills me full of lovin', oh, then she sets me free
but she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'cause when i tell her that she'll miss me when i'm gone, she says
who said i would
tell me, who said i would
who said i would

i'm not the only one, but i'll do fine
i suit her purpose and i'm just her kind
i don't own her and i never could
don't think i do, don't think i should

who said i would

but she's got a heart, must be made of stone
and when i tell her that she'll miss me when i'm gone, she says
you're not the only one, but you'll do fine
you suit my purpose and you're just my kind
you don't own me and you never could
don't think you do, don't think you should

now she knows when she calls me, i'll come running every time
and she knows she gets me hot, and she'll know it's her body, not her mind
and she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'cause when i tell her that she'll miss me when i'm gone, she says
who said i would
tell me, who said i would
who said i would
who said i would
who said i would
who said i would


you keep on walking so you don't fall down
it's the same old story
you keep on hiding so you can't be found
it's the same old story
oh but i know you, you're the one who ran
you know why, it's because you can, oh
it's all right, 'cause i don't mind
i'm just trying to help, but i wonder why
doesn't anybody stay together anymore
i wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

my friends keep falling and they can't get up
it's the same old story
well one says white and the other one black
it's the same old story
and i don't know why you keep emotions walled up
your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up
but it's all right, 'cause i don't mind
i'm just trying to help, but i wonder why
doesn't anybody stay together anymore
i wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

things can change, from a misunderstanding
nobody talks, nobody hears, oh oh oh
makes me wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
oh i wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

you keep on looking for that higher ground
it's the same old story
your glass is empty and the chips are down
it's the same old story
but i don't know why, your emotions walled up
your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up
but it's all right, 'cause i don't mind
i'm just trying to help, but i wonder why

doesn't anybody stay together anymore
i wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
oh i wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

i'm hanging on to my peace of mind
i just don't know
i'm hanging on to those good times, baby
just want to let them roll
i'm gonna make it to the light and joy
i'll tell you why
i got a woman who can take me there
the apple of my eye
oh, i just don't know, no no, no, no
i love her so
don't let me see that morning paper
'cause i don't need those dues
it's just the same old murder movie
but they call it the news
i'll tell you what would be some story
and what would set me free
is if the same thing happened to everybody
that just happened to me, oh,
i just don't know, no, no, no, no
i'll never let her go
every time i hear somebody sneakin'
up behind whoa, i turn around
but i still hear that sound
and just when i'm about to lose my mind
here comes my baby
coming my way down along that devastation trail
well tell the lord above
she's got a brand of love
that cannot fail
i'm hanging on to my peace of mind
that's no lie
i'm hanging on to my special friend
the apple of my eye
my inspiration, too
she's got a lead on my heart and
my soul and she knows just what to do
oh, i just don't know, no, no, no, no
no, i get so low, and my mind's about to go
but wait a minute, here comes my baby
coming my way down along that devastation trail
well, let the fires burn, let the floods return
we will prevail
hanging on to my peace of mind
i just don't know


i lost ten points just for being in the right place
at exactly the wrong time
i looked right at the facts there, but i may as well have
been completely blind
so, if you see me walking all alone
don't look back, i'm just on my way back home
there's a train leaves here this morning, and
i don't know, what i might be on
she signed me to a contract, baby said it would
all be so life long
i looked around then for a reason
when there wasn't something more to blame it on
but, if time makes a difference while we're gone
tell me now, and i won't be hanging on
there's a train leaves here this morning
and i don't know, what i might be on
1320 north columbus was the address
that i wrote down on my sleeve
i don't know just what she wanted
might have been that it was getting time to leave
and i watched as the smoker passed it on
and i laughed when the joker said, "lead on"
cause there's a train leaves here this morning
and i don't know, what i might be on
and there's train leaves here this morning
and i don't know, what i might be on


open up your eyes
take the devil from your mind
he's been holding on to you
and you're so hard to find
the wind outside is cold
restless feeling in my soul
tempting me to get away
but there's no place a man can go
god, will you lead me where i roam?
help me not to let my feelings show
no, no you are the one, oh, how could you be so blind?
the devil prays on runaways
he's never far behind
the many years i've tried
now have been revealed to me
closer is the love you'll find
waiting so patiently
god, will you lead me where i roam?
help me not to let my feelings show.
no, no
take the devil
take the devil
from your mind


early in the morning
about the break of day
the earlybird is working
so his life don't fade away
spends his life denying that
he's got no time for flying
in the breeze
high up on his own, the eagle flies alone
and he is free
earlybird is scratching though
the going's getting tough
time is passing by him and he just
can't get enough
he'll tell you all is well when
all is really going wrong
the earlybird will wake one day
and find his life is gone
you know i like to lay in bed
and sleep out in the sun
reading books and playing crazy music
just for fun
you know it makes feel so fine
and puts my mind at ease to
know that i don't harm a soul
in doing what i please
ah, ah, ah ah...
any old day you say,
ain't gonna fade away
any old day you say,
ain't gonna fade away


i like the way your sparkling earrings lay
against your skin so brown
with a million stars all around

'cause i got a peaceful easy feeling
and i think you won't let me down
'cause i'm already standing on the ground

and i found out a long time ago
what a woman can do to your soul
but she can't take you anyway
you don't already know how to go

'cause i got a peaceful easy feeling
and i bet you won't let me down
'cause i'm already standing on the ground

i get this feeling i may know you
as a lover and a friend
but this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
tells me i may never see you again

and i get a peaceful easy feeling
and i'm sure you won't let me down
'cause i'm already standing
oh, i'm already standing
well, i'm already standing
yes, i'm already standing on the ground


i'm just arriving in the city
and there's music on my mind
lookin' for my destination and
my home is far behind
'cause it's a long road ahead
and you can make it in the end
and i'm gonna make it with my friends
and i'm tryin'
it took me sometime to see it
now i'm looking through this world
and it's gonna take some time before
i get back, help me girl
'cause you can make it if you try
you gotta lay it on the line
and everything will be fine if you try
sittin' smokin' just a thinkin'
is an easy thing to do
we gotta keep on trying for
the feelin' to come through
and it's a lonely way to live
you gotta take it, you gotta live
if you mistake it, just try again
and i'm trying, yeah!
got to keep on trying
ah, we got to keep on trying
yeah i'm trying...


they were doolin', doolin-dalton.
high or low, it was the same,
easy money and faithless women,
red-eye whiskey for the pain.

go down, bill dalton, it must be god's will,
two brothers lyin' dead in coffeyville,
two voices call to you from where they stood.
lay down your law books now,
they're no damn good.

better keep on movin', doolin-dalton,
till your shadow sets you free
and if you're fast, and if you're lucky,
you will never see that hangin' tree.

oh the towns lay out across the dusty plains
like graveyards filled with tombstones waitin'
for the names
and a man could use his back or use his brains
but some just went stir crazy lord cause
nothin' ever changed

till bill doolin' met bill dalton
he was working cheap, just bidin' time
and then he laughed and said i'm goin'
and so he left that peaceful life behind...


twenty-one and strong as i can be
i know what freedom means to me
and i can't give the reason why
i should ever want to die
got no cause to be afraid
or fear that life will ever fade
'cause as i watch the rising sun
i know that we have just begun

i might spend my life upon the road
just tryin' to add to what i know
then someday i might settle down
and all my friends will be around

they say a man should have a stock and trade
but me, i'll find another way
i believe in getting what you can
and there ain't no stoppin' this young man

because i'm you and fast as i can be
i know what freedom means to me
and i can't give the reason why,
i should ever want to die
no i can't give the reason why
i should ever want to die


oh, my, don't the sky look spacious
with the stars all shinin' down
it's a high and lonesome sound
and i ain't had a woman in so long
i can't feed my starvin soul
come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town
we're gonna get a little out of control

there's a card game in the corner
and the barmaid smiled at me
well, i tipped her a sliver dollar and
she brought me a drink for free

all the town-folk call her the cheap one
and the gamblers call her flo
come on, set 'em up again
i got me a friend and i think i'm gettin' out of control
oh, oh, oh

she's cool water, her momma taught her
i got news, she's mine and mine alone
and if anybody's lookin' for trouble
you know i'm the one you want to try

well, i'll fight any man who wants to
and i don't care who or why

you got to gamble on your story
you got no guts, you get no glory
and i'm bettin' my money on an ace in the hole
think i'm gettin' out of control


it's another tequila sunrise
stirrin slowly across the sky
i said goodbye
he was just a hired hand
workin on the dreams he planned to try
the days go by

just another lonely boy in town
and she's out runnin' round

she wasn't just another woman
and i couldn't keep from comin' on
it's been so long
oh and it's a hollow feelin'
when it comes down to dealin' friends
it never ends

take another shot of courage
wonder why the right words never come
you just get numb
it's another tequila sunrise
and this old world still looks the same
another frame


desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
you been out ridin' fences for so long now
oh, you're a hard one
but i know that you got your reasons
these things that are pleasin' you
can hurt you somehow

don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
she'll beat you if she's able
you know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
now it seems to me some fine things
have been laid upon your table
but you only want the ones that you can't get

desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
and freedom, oh, freedom
well, that's just some people talkin'
your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
the sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
you're losin' all your highs and lows
ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
come down from your fences
open the gate
it may be rainin'
but there's a rainbow above you
you better let somebody love you
you better let somebody love you
before it's too late


he was a poor boy, raised in a small family
he kinda had a craving for somethin' no one else could see
they say that he was crazy,
the kind that no lady should meet
he ran out to the city and wandered around in the street
he wants to dance, oh yeah,
he wants to sing, oh yeah,
he wants to see the lights a flashin' and listen
to the thunder ring

he saw it in a window
the mark of a new kind of man
he kinda liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
he took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
and then one day he felt if,
he knew he could stand with the best

they got respect, oh yeah,
he wants the same, oh yeah,
and it's a certain kind of fool who
like to hear the sound of his own name
ooh...

a poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man
he had a reputation spreading like fire throught the land
it wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way
it wasn't for the runnin', but now he's runnin' everyday


i am an outlaw, i was born an outlaw's son
the highway is my legacy
on the highway i will run
in one hand i've a bible
in the other i've got a gun
well, don' you know me
i'm the man who won
woman don't try to love me
don't try to understand
a life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man

first left my woman, it was down in santa fe
all of my friends are strangers
they quickly come and go

and all my love's in danger
'cause i steal hearts and souls
woman, don't try to love me
don't try to understand a life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
ooh...

woman, don't try to love me
don't try to understand
a life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man

some me call me abel
some men call me cain
some men call me sinner, lord
some men call me saint

some say there's a jesus
some men say there ain't
when you got no life to lose
then there's nothin' left to gain
outlaw man
outlaw man


seems like a dream now, it was so long ago
the moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
and i swore that i loved her and gave her a ring
the bluebird was high on the wing

finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
she said,"tell me, oh, tell me, was i all right?"

the years brought the railroad
it ran by my door
now there's boards on the windows
and dust on the floor
and she passes the time at another man's side
and i pass the time with my pride

what a tangled web we weave
go 'round with circumstance
someone show me how to tell the dancer
from the dance

what ever happened
choosin' a friend and losin' a fight
she said,"tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?"


once i was young and so unsure
i'd try any ill to find the cure
an old man told me
tryin' to scold me
"oh, son, don't wade too deep in bitter creek,"

out where the desert meets the sky
is where i go when i wanna hide
you know there ain't no cause to weep at bitter creek

doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

we're gonna hit the road for one last time
we can walk right in and steal 'em blind
i can't wait to see the old man's face
when i win the race

doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,
doo doo doo doo doo
doo...


well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
as they came to town to face another showdown
the lawmen cleared the people from the streets
all you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seats?
watch 'em duelin', doolin-dalton, high or low, it's all the same

easy money and faithless women, you will never kill the pain
go down, bill doolin, don't you wonder why
sooner or later we all have to die?
sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
four men ride out and only three ride back

the queen of diamonds let you down
she was just an empty fable
the queen of hearts you say you never met
your twisted fate has found you out and it' finally turned the tables
stole your dreams and paid you with regret
you sealed your fate up a long time ago
now there's no time left to borrow
maybe tomorrow
maybe tomorrow

desperado
desperado

well, i heard some people talkin' just the other day
and they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
but let me tell you i got some news for you
and you'll soon find out it's true
and then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

'cause i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing this victory song
woo, hoo, hoo, my, my, woo, hoo, hoo

the letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
but i guess you felt like you had to set things right
just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
you can see the stars and still not see the light

and i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing this vict'ry song
woo, hoo, hoo, my, my, woo, hoo, hoo

well i know it wasn't you who held me down
heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
so often times it happens that we live our lives in chains
and we never even know we have the key

but me, i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing this victory song
'cause i'm already gone
yes, i'm already gone
and i'm feelin' strong
i will sing this victory song
'cause i'm already gone
yes, i'm already gone
already gone


you never cry like a lover should
sigh when it feels real good
or see the sky through the stone and wood
you never cry like a lover

i thought i saw somebody i loved
sleeping deep inside you
if i could catch you in an unguarded moment
i'd stay right here beside you

laugh out loud when we get it right
you can't get loose if there's too much light
you never smile like a lover

i can't live with you baby, can't live without it
and sometimes i believe in love
sometimes i doubt it
but your life goes on
like a broken down carousel
where somebody left the music on

you never move like you used to do
pour it out when you're feelin' blue
somebody must have put some pain on you
you never cry like a lover
cry
you never cry
come on and cry


engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
i paid my dues and i feel like trav'lin' on

a runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
so throw your rope on another man
and pull him down your way
make him into someone who can take the place of me
make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be

engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
i paid my dues and i feel like trav'lin' on
maybe i'll go to santa fe, maybe san antone,
any town is where i'm bound any way to get me gone
don't think about me, never let me cross your mind

engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
i paid my dues and i feel like trav'lin' on
i paid my dues and i feel like trav'lin' on


tell me the truth, how do you feel?
like you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels?
don't feel too bad, you're not all alone
we're all tryin' to get along
with ev'rybody else try'n' to go their way
you're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?
just go along 'til they turn out the lights
there's nothin' we can do to fight it

no man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain
and we who must remain go on living just the same

i once knew a man, very talented guy
he's sing for the people and people would cry
they knew that his song came from deep down inside
you could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes

and so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone
like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind
called him home

my man's got it made
he's gone far beyond the pain
and we who must remain go on living just the same
we who must remain go on laughing just the same


cruisin' down the center of a two way street
wond'rin' who is really in the driver's seat
mindin' my bus'ness, along comes big brother
says, "son, you better get on one side or the other"

i'm out on the border
i'm walkin' the line
don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
i'm try'n' to change this water to wine

after a hard day, i'm safe at home
foolin' with my baby on the telephone
out of nowhere somebody cuts in
and says, "hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been"

i'm out on the border
i thought this was a private line
don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
i'm try'n' to change this water to wine

never mind your name, just give us your number, mm
never mind your face, just show us your card, mm
and we wanna know whose wing are you under
you better step to the right or we can make it hard

i'm stuck on the border
all i wanted was some peace of mind
don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
i'm try'n' to change this water to wine

on the border
on the border
on the border
on the border

leave me be, i'm just walkin' this line
all i wanted was some peace of mind, peace of mind
can't you see i'm tryin' to change this water to wine?
don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
i'm sick and tired of all your law and order


james dean, james dean
i know just what you mean
james dean, you said it all so clean
and i know my life would look all right
if i could see it on the silver screen

you were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
even if you had no cause
james dean, you said it all so clean
and i know my life would look all right
if i could see it on the silver screen

we'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
you were just too cool for school
sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
the only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules
james dean, james dean
so hungry and so lean
james dean, you said it all so clean
and i know my life would look all right
if i could see it on the silver screen

little james dean, up on the screen
wond'rin' who he might be
along came a spyder and picked up a rider
and took him down the road to eternity

james dean, james dean, you bought it sight unseen

you were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
you were to fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye, bye


well, my time went so quickly
i went lickety-splitly
out to my old '55
as i pulled away slowly
feeling so holy
god knows i was feeling alive

and now the sun's coming up
i'm riding with lady luck
freeway, cars and trucks
stars beginning to fade
and i lead the parade
just a-wishin' i'd stayed a little longer
lord, don't you know, the feeling's getting stronger

six in the morning
gave me no warning
i had to be on my way
now the cars are all passing me
trucks are all flashing me
i'm headed home from your place

and now the sun's coming up
i'm riding with lady luck
freeway, cars and trucks
stars beginning to fade
and i lead the parade
just a-wishin' i'd stayed a little longer

well, my time went so quickly
i went lickety-splitly
out to my old '55
as i pulled away slowly
feeling so holy
god knows i was feeling alive

i'm riding with lady luck
freeway, cars and trucks
freeway, cars and trucks
riding with lady luck
freeway, cars and trucks
riding with lady luck
freeway, cars and trucks
riding with lady luck

when i was a lad
and old shep was a pup
over hills and meadows we'd stray
just a boy and his dog
we were both full of fun
we grew up together that way

i remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
when i would have drowned beyond doubt
but old shep was right there
to the rescue he came
he jumped in and helped pull me out

as the years fast did roll
old shep he grew old
his eyes were fast growing dim
and one day the doctor looked at me and said
i can do no more for him jim

with hands that were trembling
i picked up my gun
and aimed it at shep's faithful head
i just couldn't do it
i wanted to run
i wish they would shoot me instead

he came to my side
and looked up at me
and laid his old head on my knee
i had struck the best friend that a man ever had
i cried so i scarcely could see

old shep he has gone
where the good doggies go
and no more with old shep will i roam
but if dogs have a heaven
there's one thing i know
old shep has a wonderful home

i am just a lonesome cowboy
and i'm travelling all alone
i ain't even got a nickel
to call my baby on the phone

just beyond the mountain lies a city
and i hear it calling me
saddle up and ride you lonesome cowboy
here is where you'll find your destiny
in my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
near to me and yet so far
will i always be a lonesome cowboy
am i only reaching for a star

ride. ride, ride, ride along cowboy
sing, sing, sing, sing a song cowboy

will i ever leave this lonesome valley
really see the lights that shine
gotta find what lies beyond the mountain
gotta rope and tie that dream of mine

i am just a lonesome cowboy
and i'm travelling all alone
if you don't call me baby
then i'm never coming home


hot dog, you say you're really coming back
hot dog, i'm waiting at the railway track
hot dog, you say you're coming home for good
hot dog, i'm going to keep knocking on wood
and baby, i can hardly wait
i'm gonna meet you at the gate, hot dog

i fell in love with you and then you went away
but now you're coming home to stay
hot dog, soon everything will be all right
i've got a pocketful of dimes
it's gonna be just like old times, hot dog

you went away and every day was misery
but now you're coming back to me
hot dog, my heart is gonna go insane
hot dog, when you come walking off the train
oh how lonely i have been
but when that santa fe pulls in
hot dog, baby, baby, hot dog


i feel it in my leg,
i feel it in my shoe
tell me pretty baby
if you think you feel it too
let's have a party
let's have a party
send to the store
and let's buy some more

some people like to rock
some people like to roll
but movin' and a groovin'
gonna satisfy my soul

i've never kissed a bear
i've never kissed a goon
but i can shake a chicken
in the middle of the room

now honky tonky joe
is knockin' at the door
bring him in and fill him up
and set him on the floor


i found my thrill on blueberry hill
on blueberry hill when i found you
the moon stood still on blueberry hill
and lingered until my dreams came true

the wind in the willow played
love's sweet melody
but all of those vows we made
were never to be

tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
for you were my thrill on blueberry hill


suntanned, windblown, honeymooners at last alone
feeling far above par, oh how lucky we are
while i give to you and you give to me
true love, true love
so, on and on it will always be
true love, true love
for you and i have a guardian angel on high
with nothing to do but to give to you
and to give to me love forever true


don't leave me now
now that i need you
how blue and lonely i'd be
if you should say we're through

don't break my heart
this heart that loves you
they'll just be nothing for me
if you should leave me now

what good is dreamin'
if i must dream all alone by myself
without you darling
my arms would gather dust

come to these arms
these arms that need you
don't close your eyes to my plea
don't leave me now


have i told you lately that i love you?
could i tell you once again somehow?
have i told with all my heart and soul how i adore you?
well darling i'm telling you now

have i told you lately when i'm sleeping
every dream i dream is you somehow?
when you're not with me?
well darling i'm telling you now

my heart would break in two if i should lose you
i'm no good without you anyhow
and have i told you lately that i love you
well darling i'm telling you now

my heart would break in two if i should lose you
i'm no good without you anyhow
and have i told you lately that i love you
well darling i'm telling you now


i need you so
to keep me happy
if i can't have you
i cannot go on

i need your arms
around me tightly
when you're not at home

when the day is done
i miss you so
i lie and wait
to hear you knock on the door

when you leave me
i try not to worry
come back in a hurry
'cause i need you so

when the day is done
i miss you so
i lie and wait
to hear you knock on the door

when you leave me
i try not to worry
come back in a hurry
'cause i need you so


every time i look at someone new
tell me why i think of you
then you sometimes ask me by
you're playing with love
darling tell me why

you left me all alone
to cry over you
my heart is torn and broken
there's nothing left to do

in my prayers, i'll mention you
when you're gone i feel so blue
why can't i have all of you
oh, somebody, please tell me why


oh, if you tell a lie
you know that i'll forgive you
though you say our love is just a game
and when you hear my name
you'll say i'm from a strange world
but is it so strange to be in love with you

is it so strange
that i love you more than all the world
is it so strange
i have no eyes for any other girl

oh won't you take me back
and say that you still love me
to waste a love like ours would be a sin
let us kiss again
let me hold you near
and take me from this strange world
that i'm living in


is what i'm now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true

just call my name
and i'll be right by your side
i want your sweet helping hand
my love's too strong to hide

always lived, very quiet life
i ain't never did no wrong
now i know that life without you
has been too lonely too long

is what i'm now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true

always lived, very quiet life
i ain't never did no wrong
now i know that life without you
has been too lonely too long

is what i'm now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true

don't leave me here with all these heartaches,
only you and heaven knows
about my troubles troubles troubles.

when it rains, it really pours...

you know you thrill me from head to toe.
i got a feeling for you baby
and you're the only one who knows
about my troubles, troubles, troubles.

when it rains, it really pours...

you know what you did to make me love you
you really opened up my nose.
you got what you wanted, now you left me.
that's the way the story goes.
well, i got troubles, troubles, troubles.

when it rains, it really pours.


i don't want my heart to be broken
'cause it's the only one i've got
so darling please be careful
you know i care a lot

let's have a party

and let's buy some more

some people like to rock
some people like to roll
but movin' and a groovin'
gonna satisfy my soul

i've never kissed a bear
i've never kissed a goon
but i can shake a chicken
in the middle of the room

now honky tonky joe
is knockin' at the door
bring him in and fill him up
and set him on the floor


jennifer lost the war today
through it all
she must have wondered
what have i done
but nobody really cares today
the world's a busy place
guess she must have really sinned

i guess we're all just soldiers
she was only six years old
left to die by strangers
her family waits
and if we're all just soldiers
is it so wrong to be afraid

phoebe lost the war today
there must be some mistake
say it happens all the time
and it's said and done
and little miss 1565 your soul remains unclaimed
guess you must have really sinned

morality won't help her
when she lies silent in a morgue
and all our sorrows just don't count at all
but will the morning headlines
even say that it's a shame
what are we headin' for

seen it all before
silent on the ground
as he's walking away
and i wonder how many more
everybody takes it
like it's nothing at all
jennifer lost the war


when we younger
there always seemed like
some perfect mold
that we're supposed to be
but now we're growing up and
i see it's just not that way
now i feel like someone's lied to me

'cause i've been true
made good for you
and now i feel used
i'm asking you
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
to be like you

tell me now elders
what were your reasons for
making it seem
like you were so much more
if you want to feel good
because of our accomplishments
don't you just do it yourself

'cause i've tried
man i've tried
while you all lied
so now just tell me
how does it feel
how does it feel


look at my soldier boy now
with that big gun in your little hand
as you patrol this foreign land
hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet

now do you see the light
fading while your world is crumbling
out on patrol
and all you can do is sit and stare
what revelation have you now
what culmination to your speck of life
your moment in time

as you sit here all alone
will your buddies come and save your life
but as the enemy appears
see your life flash before your eyes

now do you see the light
fading while your world is crumbling
out on patrol
and all you can do is sit and stare
what revelation have you now
what culmination to your speck of life
your moment in time

now do you see the light
fading while your world is crumbling
out on patrol
and all you can do is sit and stare
what revelation have you now
what culmination to your speck of life
your moment in time

it's your life
it's your life
it's your life

it's your life
it's your life
it's your life

uno, dos, tres, quatro


time has washed away
and now i may wonder
how did it all slip by
'cause i always thought
we had forever
future calls to me
to take me away from things
i don't want to leave behind
like i'm slipping away
i can't hold on

find that path alone
crossroads lead me away
but that's not what worries me
i just want to know what's home

find that path alone
crossroads lead me away
but that's not what worries me
i just want to know what's home

through it all
my mind still wanders
to the one who touched my soul
though her road leads away
she's still my
true love
i could believe

will is not enough when all those
lost days stand in the way
but she was
my hopes and dreams my
whole world
i could believe

i still want to know
who can see for me
crossroads tell me

now you'll have to trade
your past away
and find another day
so is change a friend or an enemy

through what comes to pass
i'll find my way
i've seen it all before
but is the best you can be
the best thing to be
some people say
you're just wasting time
but that's not what worries me
i just want to know what's home


clouds pass over the moon
like an eye that shows impending doom
tension in this misty air
souls pass into the room
drawn in by a lost memory
you will join them in the moonlight

you are my offering
your soul transcends
the centuries of pain
your misery in life
is your ecstasy in death

time passes like the wind
as we race to beat days dusky grin
mornings just a moment away
your body glistens in candlelight
as we all look on in fiendish delight
the ritual is just beginning

come fulfill the prophecy
with our demons of debauchery
as virgins and spectres sing
this madness will never cease

you will follow
in the footsteps of many others
who have come before
i will show you the altar
your aztec eyes, egyptian hair
your beauty bestowed upon my lair
i've loved you before, in other lives
but you've never meant as much to me
never meant as much to me as now

where blood is spilt
that will never spill again
but in your linen robes
we want you now
we want you now
you could never ask for more than that

you are my offering
your soul transcends
the centuries of pain
your misery in life
is your ecstasy in
come fulfill the prophecy
with our demons of debauchery
this madness will never cease


mommy doesn't have a head any more
keep it underneath my bed on the floor
well that's alright, that's ok
she never really used her head anyway

daddy called me a silly bore
bet he won't say that any more
because the way his body is severed too
his vocal chords are gonna be hard to use

beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

watch my girl friend come to the door
chop off her head, she falls to the floor
now watching my baby's jugular blow
really makes my motor go

wrap a towel round the bloody stump
take my baby's body to the city dump
then wipe the mess off the bloody axe
scoop all the heads into my burlap sack

beheaded, watch her spurt like a garden hose
beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

all my collection, adorns my room on bamboo poles
use to be a little, but a little got more and more
now i'm craving yours


off with her head
off with her head
off with her head
off with her head
off with her head
off with her head

find another victim for my machine
put him in a home-made guillotine
blade falls, gonna need a casket
watch your head plop in a wicker basket

leave the house at a quarter to four
come back with sixteen or more
cause the more i walk, the more i see
i got a funny feeling coming over me

beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes


in your plane in the blue sky
you roam again
words that echo in your mind
make your heart beat faster
this is no vietnam
we will win in iran

the president said let it ride
islam be damned
make your last stand
in tehran

warrior, the time bombs
about to go
what will you feel
will you even wonder
if the man that's in your sights
ever kissed his girl goodbye

the captain said kill or die
islam be damned
make your last stand
in tehran

great satan
our flags our burning

soon america may find
its young men in the sand
where their casualty
is just a number
in iran

the president said let it ride
you will be damned
make your last stand
in tehran


ask me no questions and i'll tell you
i'll tell you no lies
when all is said and done
does it really matter who's wrong or right
don't ask me for a reason, i can't explain
why we hurt one another again and again
as i lie bleeding here i still
i still reach for you

a thousand days
have passed away
a thousand days
were captured in her eyes

your eyes are open now but you know
it's still hard to see inside
when action and intention
are two separate things
now i somehow wish i could explain
why we hurt each other again and again
like someone on his dying breath
i still reach for you

a thousand days
have passed away
a thousand days
were captured in her eyes

forever we've been
trapped by our hearts
trapped by our minds
i'd like to leave
i'd like to win at love

but i just can't let it go
and i just can't watch it slipping away
and i just can't let it go
and i just can't stand another minute

maybe now someday our shattered live
will mend themselves again
but now a million miles away
i still wish i could
and though i somehow know, i can't explain
why we hurt one another again and again
like someone on his dying breath
i still reach for you


in this world of hate and shallowness
where enemies become your consolation
and those of us who win the game give up our minds
i don't call that winning
say this doesn't apply to you
but ask yourself first
what have i done today to win the game
and just what have i sacrificed

win the battle lose the war
i know i've played this game before
when people were still real
i don't want this anymore
it's time for me to close the door
there's nothing left to feel

reflect on all our yesterdays
my own words choke me
why were they spoken
regret for the things i've said and done
just can't compare with
regret for those that i have never tried
so blame this world or blame yourself
it's really all the same
when you are standing on the precipice
from which you just cannot return

win the battle or lose the war
i know i've played this game before
when people were still real
i don't want this anymore
it's time for me to close the door
there's nothing left to feel

in the style of forgotten men
i look to my horizon
i see nothing
while thoughts of guns and desecration
sweep through my mind
but only coffins and bones remain
as i look to you
the emptiness behind your eyes
seals my decision
can't carry on in this world of jugglers
where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeonings
your key to success
what kind of tradition to carry on

blackball the new disease
blackball the new disease
blackball your evil ways
have found their way inside me

blackball the new disease
blackball the new disease
blackball for a better life
in this high tech dog eat dog existence


once i had a friend that i could count on
so i thought
well so it seemed
but times of need are not enough
to prove your friendship to me now
once i saw a face that i believed in
but a mask was all there was
so who wears the masks and who wears the faces
well i guess i'll never know

but as i stand here alone in a room full of people
with nothing to say
beer on their minds, and smoke in the air
call them friends but they just don't care

friend for life
such shallow words for broken minds
show me a friend for life
'cause i'll be waiting for that day to arrive
when i'll feel alive
i'll be waiting for that day

once i found a love i had to know
now we might know each other just too well
'cause when we're together we just can't get enough
or is it we just can't get what we want
once i saw a dream, i had to chase it
dreams quickly turn to reality
who's at fault in this game of yours and mine
well i guess i'll never know

but as i sit here alone
think of the girl who came softly inside me
the look in her eyes, the smell of her hair
call her my own but is she really there?

love for life
such noble words for noble minds
show me a love for life
'cause i'll be waiting for that day to arrive
when i'll feel alive
i'll be waiting for that day

once i had a friend that i could count
times of need are not enough
once i found a love i had to know
now we might know each other just too well
once i saw a dream i had to chase
dreams quickly turn to reality
now let me close my eyes
because i don't want to see anything anymore


in a world without leaders
who'd start all the wars?
the world that you're saving
will always be yours

kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
unify with that single line
stop the man with the power of the government
a leader's not the center of democracy

in a world without leaders
who'd make people starve?
the world that we're saving
will always be ours

everyone says, well maybe i'll make a difference
thinking they've got plenty of time
but you're squeezed a little tighter everyday
punished before you can commit a crime

in a world without leaders
who'd start all the wars?
the world that you're saving
will always be yours

kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
unify with that single line
stop the man with the power of the government
a leader's not the center of democracy

america, all of your enemies come from within
but you lash out so it is seen like some frightened child
in an angry world or the fall of rome
your demise comes from your own hands

in a world without leaders
who'd start all the wars?
the world that you're saving
will always be yours

in a world without leaders
we might have a chance
but we'll never see it
as long as there's

kill the president
kill the president
kill the president
kill the president
kill the president
kill the president now!


i've been told that to get what you want
you just gotta give what you can
but i know for what i want it don't come easy as that
they say, "look out, boy
tomorrow comes and things will look better by then."
but i'll look out the window
then look in the mirror at the same old me again

still can't get it right
still can't get it right
still can't get it right
and for all i know
i swear i never will

do you think you'd sell your soul
to just have one thing to turn out right?
for the thousandth time you turn and find
that it just makes no difference to try
like holden caulfield, i tell myself
there's got to be a better way
then i lay in bed and stare at the ceiling
dream of brighter days

still can't get it right
still can't get it right
still can't get it right
and for all i know
i swear i never will

no way out
same old stuff always drags me down
no way out
never gonna get it

still can't get it right
still can't get it right
still can't get it right
and for all i know
i swear i never
never never never never get it

we are one with ourselves
well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop
the walls come tumbling down

we are one, we are weak
we are gonna make ourselves extinct

we are one, you know it's true
it's a mentality that kills the best, we better stop
the walls come tumbling down

we are one, we are free
we are headed for obscurity
we are one, we are weak
we are gonna make ourselves extinct

we are one, it won't be news
hang ourselves with one collective noose
well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop
the walls come tumbling down

we are headed for obscurity
we are one, we are weak
we are gonna make ourselves extinct

hey you're a riddle
i say as i move aside
like i really need your advice
but you won't leave it alone
little men try but don't get a lot done
living in sin doesn't move me either way
i get a feeling you're so vague
like i said before
little men come when anything goes

when the rain comes i sit home and pray
make it all numb - i wish it all away
all i really need is just somewhere to hide away

kick him when he's down
here alone i'll put up and fight
kick him when he's down
kick him when he's down
hey don't worry, i'll get along home alright

hey, everybody's supposed to be the same
so how come they're so lame?
it's like taking a fall
keep on running back into that wall
awake in a dream, get up and go to work
but i'm feeling like such a jerk
like i said before
little men come when everything goes

when the rain comes i sit home and pray
make it all numb - i wish it all away
all i really need is just somewhere to hide away

kick him when he's down
here alone i'll put up and fight
kick him when he's down
kick him when he's down
hey don't worry, i'll get along home alright

so you're a riddle
i say as i move aside
like i really need your advice
but you won't leave it alone
little men try but don't get a lot done
living in sin don't move me either way

when you won't go along
some will feel like you can't find your way
heaven knows
heaven knows i've seen it all before

now don't get me wrong
i've seen many a life gone astray
when someone goes
all your bows won't make it any better so let it go

shut up and take it like a man
you need us to get a life
for your own good we'll take you by the hand
'cause you need a little more

maybe no one will say it
maybe no one's aware it goes on
all i know
all i know it's like going off the deep end

could you make a decision?
could you think for yourself and go on?
everyone knows
everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes

shut up and take it like a man
you need us to get a life
for your own good we'll take you by the hand
'cause you need a little more

close your eyes
look away now
make believe while you can

so you'd best go along
don't let on if you can't find your way
many more
many more do it for you
because heaven knows
heaven knows it's like playing with fire
your life's a throw

in my own simple way
i think she wants me only
she said "come over right away."
but she's just not that way
her little soul is stolen
see her put on her brand new face

pull the shades
razor blades
you're so tragic
i hate you so
but love you more
i'm so elastic
the things you say
games you play
dirty magic

i should know better than
to think i'd reach inside her
it's all a cloudy kind of daze
she's not so sweet today
she mocks me, i'm no fighter
it all just seems like such a waste

pull the shades
razor blades
you're so tragic
i hate you so
but love you more
i'm so elastic
the things you say
games you play
dirty magic

it's oversimplified
it's oversimplified
it's oversimplified
it's oversimplified

pull the shades
razor blades
you're so tragic
i hate you so
but love you more
i'm so elastic
the things you say
games you play
dirty magic


when you're feeling low
hypodermic's where you go
when you're with yourself
you wish you could be someone else

can't you see like you saw anymore
can't you feel like you felt before
can't you face anything anymore

when life's a waste
run away
your life's a waste
run away

once you get a ride
doesn't matter where you lied
once you shoot it in
doesn't matter who you've been

can't you see like you saw anymore
can't you feel like you felt before
can't you face anything anymore

when life's a waste
run away
your life's a waste
run away

you're reaching in
but you don't know where to begin
all your dance and song
won't matter when you're gone

can't you see like you saw anymore
can't you feel like you felt before
can't you face anything anymore

when life's a waste
run away
your life's a waste
run away
run away
run away
run away

run away


i think i'm burning up inside
i think i'll take a little ride
i'm gonna light up everything in sight
i'll drive on by your yard
and throw a molotov cocktail at your car
then another in the local bar

ignition
they call it an obsession
i think it's kinda neat
yeah, i'm a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah, i'm a pyro

i'm gonna set your house on fire
i'll dance around the pretty flames
such a wonderful game

i want to make a tiki torch
i'm gonna throw it on your porch
then i'm gonna run away
and come back another day

ignition
they call it an obsession
i think it's kinda neat
yeah, i'm a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah, i'm a pyro

so many houses, so little time
so many reasons, i'm not a crime
i'd like to set you up
i'd like to set you up

ignition
they call it an obsession
i think it's kinda neat
yeah, i'm a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah, i'm a pyro
i wanna burn it up
yeah, i'm a pyro
yeah, i'm a pyro
yeah, i'm a pyro


once you said you'd stick to it until the end
i guess you lied, they call it suicide
now you're gone
what was so wrong that you couldn't find a way to carry on
second guess
did i do my best
there was a friend i had

johnny was a weirdo so
what did you expect?
i'm just trying to survive myself

i should have known, you went through it alone
i wonder why. did you even try?
you could have come to me
i would have helped you see
you could have found a way to carry on
second guess
did i do my best
there was a friend i had

johnny was a weirdo so
what did you expect?
i'm just trying to survive myself

'johnny's strange behavior
was a tip-off,' they say
i'm just living day by day

little things, little lives hanging 'til the end
i say it doesn't really mean nothing
telling truth, telling lies
i used to have a friend
i say it don't really mean nothing
and i can't let this feeling go
let this feeling go
let this feeling go
let this, let it go

once you said you'd stick to it until the end
i guess you lied, they call it suicide
now you're gone
what was so wrong that you couldn't find a way to carry on
second guess
did i do my best
there was a friend i had

johnny was a weirdo so
what did you expect?
i'm just trying to survive myself

'johnny's strange behavior
was a tip-off,' they say
i'm just living day by day


when cops are taking care of business i can understand
but the l.a. story's gone way out of hand
their acts of aggression, they say they're justified
but it seems an obsession has started from the inside

they're shooting anyone who even tries to run
they're shooting little kids with toy guns
take it to a jury but they don't give a damn
because the one who tells the truth is always the policeman

beat whoever you see
don't need a reason

the city of l.a. feels like a prison
with helicopters overhead and bullets whizzing by
martial law ain't no solution
police brutality's just social pollution

beat all the white trash
beat whoever you see
don't need a reason

they say they're keeping the peace but i'm not buying it
because a billy club ain't much of a pacifier
"protecting your freedom", man, that's just a lie
it's an excuse for power that's more like an alibi

law and order doesn't really matter
when you're the one getting bruised and battered
you take it to a jury, they'll throw it in your face
because justice in l.a. comes in a can of mace now

beat whoever you see
don't need a reason
l.a.p.d.
l.a.p.d.
l.a.p.d.


things are coming down on me
they never seem to let it be
it seems like everything i say just starts another fight
the pressure's building up inside
shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright

gonna break it
and never stop running
making nothing from something
making nothing from something

cut me for the lion's share
it's mindless, but i don't care
'cause no matter what i say i'm in another fight
broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright

gonna break it
and never stop running
making nothing from something
making nothing from something

gonna break it
and never stop running
making nothing from something
making nothing from something


look at me while i look at you
seeing eye to eye we can never do
you try to tell me what is right
i may not know a lot but i know one thing

if you've got the answer
then i don't want to know
if you've got the answer
just keep it your own

i wonder why our world is ablaze
sometimes i speak aloud to hear what people have to say
i try to have an open mind
but your brain and mouth must not be connected

if you've got the answer
then i don't want to know
if you've got the answer
just leave me alone

i would be patient but it takes so long
i don't want all this misinformation
all the words that you say
lean on me while i lean on you
if we destroy each other
we might save a life or two
a little sun, a little shine
separates us both by forever and a day

if you've got a vision
then i don't want to see
if you've got a notion
don't waste it on me


ah, it's time to relax
you know what that means
a glass of wine, your favorite easy chair
and of course, this compact disc
playing on your home stereo

so, go on, and indulge yourself!
that's right, kick off your shoes
put your feet up!
lean back and just enjoy the melodies
after all, music soothes even the savage beast


our generation sees the world
not the same as before
we might as well just throw it all

and live like there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow

we are the ones
who are living under the gun, everyday
you might be gone before you know

so live like there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow

hey, believe it
the official view of the world has changed
in a whole new way
live fast 'cause if you don't take it
you'll never make it

so if you understand me
and if you feel the same
then you will know what nitro means

you'll live like there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow
there's no tomorrow!


hey man, you know i'm really ok
the gun in my hand will tell you the same
but when i'm in my car, don't give me no crap
'cause the slightest thing and i just might snap

when i go driving, i stay in my lane
but getting cut off; it makes me insane

open the glove box
reach inside
'cause i got a bad habit
of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
i got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
and it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
oh oh ooh oh

they say the road's a dangerous place
if you flip me off, i'll get in your face
you drive on my ass
your foot's on the gas
and your next breath is your last

'cause i got a bad habit
of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
i got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
and it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
oh

drivers are rude
such attitudes
but when i show my piece
complaints cease, something's odd
i feel like i'm god

i open the glove box
reach inside
'cause i got a bad habit
of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
i got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
and it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
oh oh ooh oh


starry sky, oh starry sky
tell me if you can
why do all you favors fall?
is this in your plan?

every hour of every day
she'll await for you
she'll await a thousand years
and save herself for you

bible man, oh bible man
tell me if you know
why do all the straighter vein
wreck upon the shore?

every hour of every day
she'll await for you
she'll await a thousand years
and save herself for you

her love is like the sea
crushing endlessly

every hour of every day
she'll await for you

every hour of everyday
she'll await for you
she'll await a thousand years
and save herself for you

her love is like the sea
crushing endlessly

her love is like the sea
crushing endlessly

every hour of everyday
she'll await for you
she'll await a thousand years
and save herself
and save herself
and save herself
for you


you said you'd never love me
i said you'd never try
i can't believe this world is gonna die

and why can't you get me on the line?
i swear to you i ain't got much time

you said you'd never need me
i said you'd never care
i can't believe this world is gonna end

and why can't you get me on the line?
i swear to you i ain't got much time

oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh oh

and why can't you get me on the line?
i swear to you i ain't got much time

oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh oh


where i come from isn't all that great
my automobile isn't all that great
my fashion sense is a little whack
got nothin' in my pocket

i didn't go to boardin' schools
preppie girls never looked at me
why should they? i ain't nobody
got nothin' in my pocket

beverly hills, that's where i want to be
livin' in beverly hills
beverly hills, rollin' like a celebrity
livin' in beverly hills

look at all those movie stars
they're all so beautiful and clean
when the housemaids scrub the floors
they get the spaces in between

i wanna live a life like that
i wanna be just like a king
take my picture by the pool
'cause i'm the next big thing

beverly hills, that's where i want to be
livin' in beverly hills
beverly hills, rollin' like a celebrity
livin' in beverly hills

the truth is i don't stand a chance
it's somethin' that you're born into
and i just don't belong

no i don't
i'm just a no class, beat down fool
and i will always be that way
i might as well enjoy my life
and watch the stars play

beverly hills, that's where i want to be
livin' in beverly hills
beverly hills, rollin' like a celebrity
livin' in beverly hills

beverly hills
beverly hills
beverly hills
beverly hills
livin' in beverly hills


i thought that he was cool.
i thought that he was strong
and then one day he proved me wrong.
he said he felt one way, but acted like another,
he just wanted to fit in.
he was all along
and he couldn't resist,
the temptation was to strong,
now hes all alone
trying hard not to look back
'cause if he does he might regret.


you want it
you got it

you flaunt it and
get your feet on the ground
and love me right now

you like it
you hate it

you bought it and
glued your butt to the sound
and love me right now

you couldn't change the world
to fit your little thing, ah... uh

you couldn't change the world
to fit your little thing, ah


go with the flow
it's the morning after
don't pick on, don't pick on me

'cause i don't believe in a burn like that
i pick up my donuts for free
and when she come 'round her picture captures me

so get with the groove
'cause it hurts me so bad
don't trifle, don't stifle me

'cause i don't expect to be torn to shreds
every time i am in need
and when she comes 'round her picture captures me

and when she comes around
whoa whoa-oa
whoa-oa-oa

i don't expect to be torn to shreds
every time i am in need
and when she comes 'round her picture captures me... me

and when she comes around
whoa whoa-oa

so get with the groove
'cause it hurts me so bad
don't trifle, don't stifle me... yeah
don't trifle, don't stifle me... yeah
don't trifle, don't stifle me, oh


the wrong way is the only way that i rub

i stand there oh so still
i must be on some pill
'cause no one wants to see that i'm alive

people think that i just came down from mars

i don't say anything
this is why i sing
to get these stupid feelings off my chest

i drop a line, but nothing seems to stick

i fumble for my shoes
i sing the white-boy blues
a ghetto sucka gets some other dates

i don't say anything
this is why i sing
to get these stupid feelings off my chest


hey, neighbour
can you give me the time?
it always feels like it's rock-thirty in my mind
are you up for it?
are you ready to run?
turn it out and shout your way through the next song

i am only happy when it's possible

fifteen minutes to rock
it only takes
ten minutes to rock
it only takes
five minutes to rock
it only takes, ooh

fifteen minutes to rock
it only takes
ten minutes to rock
it only takes
five minutes to rock
it only takes, ooh

don't matter
any time, any day
just come for fun and all will be okay
poindexter
nothing to figure out
every line can rock so stop worrying about

i am only happy when it's possible

fifteen minutes to rock
it only takes
ten minutes to rock
it only takes
five minutes to rock
it only takes, ooh

fifteen minutes to rock
it only takes
ten minutes to rock
it only takes
five minutes to rock
it only takes, ooh

i am listening for a spark
hold yourself for the good part
i am listening
'cause i want to hear a hitch
i want to hear it quick
we're all diving in it
i am listening


commotion
fills up all of the space
don't you know i won't show if i've got my own place
'cause i want to hear a hitch
i want to hear it quick
hell, you can rest assured
hey, neighbour

i am only happy when it's possible

fifteen minutes to rock
it only takes
ten minutes to rock
it only takes
five minutes to rock
it only takes, ooh

fifteen minutes to rock

ten minutes to rock

until the day and my goddess away
for you under planet and feed you a pomagranite
the lady will be faking love
from a firey pit

lights up a bright room

i watch you rest with lunar eclipses
come up from a goddess of love
come with me goddess of love

goddess of love
goddess of love!


just two good old boys
never meaning no harm
beats all you never saw
been in trouble with the law
since the day they was born

straightening the curves
flattening the hills
well, someday the mountain might get 'em
but the law never will

making their way
the only way they know how
that's just a little bit more
than the law will allow

just two good ol' boys
wouldn't change if they could
they're fighting the system
like two modern-day robin hoods


headache, you give me such a headache
and i don't know why
headache, you can be such a headache
'cause you're so uptight

sometimes it's just so hard
to put up with you
i've come to rely on a pill or two
cause you cause me such pain
why does it act this way?
i'm so frustrated with everything
won't you be nice?
bring some ice for my head?

headache, you give me such a headache
and i don't know why
headache, you can be such a headache
'cause you're so uptight

sometimes it's just so hard
to sleep beside you
while we're in bed
i still lie awake

with a headache, you can be such a headache
and i don't know why
headache, you can be such a headache, yeah

in my head
in my head
in my head...

and i don't know why


how can you go on this way?
a waste of every day
it's meaningless and sad
and i just have to say
that no one really wants to see you try
i think you're a hundred times as good

now what makes you want to stay?
i ask it everyday
it's not as if they had

respect for what you say
'cause they don't really want you to succeed
they're happy with the way you have a need for them
i think you should push them all away
even if you stay and succeed
you will know that it's nonsense
and it doesn't wash off for a very long time

so don't be the one that didn't have the nerve
to stand up for yourself because you had to serve
someone with some pretty dumb ideas


ain't that bad a place
i was born that way
i bite my fingernails
still got bills to pay
you sure know what to say
i'll put you in your place
land of the free, i'm on my way

i love the usa
i love the usa
i love the usa

stop at coffee bean
this is like a dream
let's run across the beach
mama, what's the deal?
nothin's wrong with me
still waters running deep
home of the brave, dog on a leash

i love the usa
i love the usa
i love the usa

and god save the king
god save the king
god save the king
won't feel a thing
god save the king
god save the king
god save the king

i love the usa
i love the usa
i love the usa

i love the usa

planes up in the sky
there's a missing man
a boy who didn't make it


you know i'd like to think
that you've been pretty cool
but i have given up lying to myself
you know it makes me laugh
to see you doing well
but it never fails to leave me so mystified
i'd like to know i don't think
that i will ever understand

feeling pretty good about the big success
what makes people feel, the need to get their fill?


i guess it's not too hard to preach it to the choir
when you show them how to sing it and they sing along

i'd like to know i don't think that i will ever understand
it beats me down a little further every single day

i've made a natural selection of course it's none of the above

i'd like to know i don't think that i will ever understand
i want to feel like i don't have to try and understand


i understand the need to feel love
but this time you've gone way too far
and now you believe that everyone's bad
and everyone's evil inside
i don't understand how you can think that way
'cause there is a book and it says that this is all true

i understand the need to feel safe
but this time you've gone way too far


it's easy to see when you believe
that we're all so evil inside
there are so many that want you to think that way

'cause there is a book and it says that this is all true
yes there is a book and it says that this is all true
there is a book and it says that this is all true
yes there is a book and it says that this is all true


any day now you'll call me up on the phone
say you love me more than you ever did before

it's all that i can do right now
to make it up to you somehow
and meet you on the other side of home

take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war
that we're waging on each other forever more

it's all that i can do right now
to make it up to you somehow
and meet you on the other side of home
say you love me now

it's all that i can do right now
to make it up to you somehow
and meet you on the other side of home
say you love me now

take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war
that we're waging on each other forever more
that we're waging on each other forever more


would you like some lemonade?
no, this ain't no minutemaid
just today i picked them fresh
from the tree that i love best
couldn't let them rot away
like my father used to say

oh, happy day
lemonade

long ago, i didn't know
didn't care and couldn't grow
on my way in such a fuss
passed the tree and catch the bus
till the day i couldn't pass
fallen lemons in my path
so with my mom, i now agree
and use the lemons life gives me

oh, happy day
lemonade

hard times come to me


baby, life's what you make it

yesterday's faded
nothing can change it
life's what you make it

i got you when i was sane, yeah

listen up for goodness sakes
me, i've never have much breaks
opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
whoa, down

and the love you gave to me
will increase my will to be, be... down, yeah

listen up for goodness sakes

never before have i fallen for someone who'd go on and do me like this
you were the one who would always follow through with the ease of building care
for a kiss

say you love me
say you love me

get out the house 'cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up
and say
betting on losers is always a good way to lose what you wanted to prove

say you love me

you should be talking better
but still you tried to better me
and now you'll be making the truth


you should be talking better

and now you'll be making the truth

get out the house 'cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up

everytime that i turn around
and just hear the same ol thing.
trucks are tryin' to rock my back
to the place i couldn't keep.

we don't care about anything.

my brain is working overtime
i need something to ease my mind
'cause as my thoughts go manic
i really start to panic
there's no place to hind behind

i'm freaking and hallucinating
going last when i should wait
my parents think i'm crazy
but damn i'm going crazy
i can't help my mental state

no
take these brains out of my way

i work into a frenzied fit
i bite the corners of my lip
i'm losing my appetite
my pants don't even fit right
take away the the month old dip
give me something for my hair
a fresher pair of underwear
'cause if i was run over
by a brand new range rover
i just want it, i don't care

no
take these brains out of my way

it's you who decides what sick or health
and all the people i see
that's making lots of benji's
make me want to puke myself
start a brand new fashion trend
those are for the deeper end
sedatives and no doz
and edible pantyhose
they're on your plate so dig right in!

i don't care

my summer girl
she was my world
he's got her now
charmed her some how

i know i'm not your type
i know i'm not your type
i know i'm not your type
i'll never be your type

all summer long
feelings grew strong


all through the time
i was not blind

my summer girl
my summer girl
my summer girl
my summer girl

i'll never be your type
i'll never be your type...


everybody, don't make me laugh
'cause it's not so insane
in the morning it comes to pass
and there's no one to blame

i'll tell you
my weakness

and if you knew the things i say
then you'd have to believe
in the spirits above the sand
and the man in the tree

i'll tell you
my weakness

if you like it there
i'll be most everywhere
tell me to stay
leave me to stay

i'll tell you
my weakness

if you like it there
i'll be most everywhere
tell me to stay
leave me to stay


is this it, are we done?
must we carry on?
like such fools shameless fools
is it finally over?
why when i call must you take so long?
maybe weeks sometimes months
for you to call me back


my friends were right
should have played it smooth
should have tried to laugh


instead of being true

i feel so numb inside
as i rest my head to go to sleep

one more time
though i know it's wrong
maybe you should do mine
and everything is fine



are you ready?

this place inside my mind
a place i'd like to hide
you don't know the chances
what if i should die?

a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you don't know the chances
i'm so blind
blind
blind

another means i'll find
to escape the pain inside
you don't know the chances
what if i should die?

a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you don't know the chances
i'm so blind
blind
blind

deeper and deeper and deeper as i dream to
live a life that seems to be
a lost reality
that i can never find a way to reach
my inner self-esteem is low
how deep can i go
in the ground that i lay
if i don't find a way to
see through the gray that clouds my mind
this time i look to see what's between the lines

i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind

i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind

i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind
i can see, i can see i'm goin' blind

i'm blind
i'm blind
i'm blind
i'm blind


there you are alone
with no hope of ever having something to be proud of
something earned without begging
yes, i know you're a person, a person close to me.

ball tongue!
they've come to enslave me
ball tongue!
they've jacked themselves onto me.
ball tongue!
ball tongue!
they've come not to save them, but they take...

ball tongue!
and then, the man kept kickin' me.
ball tongue!

ball tongue!
he wasn't dead and then they knocked him on the head.
ball tongue!
no more, he's rid of you
and you're a dyke

why did you tease me? made me feel upset?
i am ugly, please just go away

i can see it's hard to find
this blessing in disguise
why do you treat me this way?
made the hate stay

as i walk i can never seem to escape
all the laughing, all the pain
if you were me, what would you do?
nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away

i can see it's hard to find
this blessing in disguise
why do you treat me this way?

"you faget! get away, we don't want none."
i'm sick and tired of people treating me this way every day

to all the people that think i'm strange
that i should be out of here, locked up in a cage
you don't know what the hell is up now anyway
you got this pretty boy feeling like i'm enslaved

i can in every way
mistake the pain i feel inside
it comes at me
evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
who are you to say that i can't speak what's on my mind?
it runs away
it's so predictable

i can in every way
feel the stress that tangles up inside
too blind to see
emptiness and the sorrow of their lives
you run away
to the cover of their pointless ties
you ask me
it's so predictable

i'm gonna try
i'm gonna die
i'm gonna try

another day
silence overwhelms my mind
who's to say if i have the time or why?
should i pray for all the hate to go away?
another day
i can never break free

you wait for me
i crawl up to you
another day
i'll live forever

why should i?

i'm gonna try
i'm gonna die
i'm gonna try

oh

why do you try to justify?
you are just too scared to be you inside


look at you, all i see is a man too afraid to really be

you try so hard to be wanted
false emotions tears you fronted

you're too afraid to really be someone who isn't false, who doesn't care to be
you're too afraid to really be, be yourself, let you come through

search through these problems that haunt and taunt you?

living life

pain is god
painful thoughts occur

in denial
i tried to be your friend
i tried to be
a good boy

a hate deep inside
startle me
someone save me

now these memories
fill my heart
they bury me

all i want to do
is kill you
all i want to do
is kill you
all i want to do
is kill you

looking back
i was never ever right
you were my stepmom
who always wanted me out of your sight

i would come walking in and i'd say, "hello"
but you would slap me
but i tried to let it pass
but the pictures in my head were with you
with a knife up your ass laying dead
so i popped some more caps in your ass
now your son is not so fun

you make my life
not so good

all i want to do
is kill you
all i want to do
is kill you

is kill you

i wanna play, you know it's time.
something is calling, i can't keep from falling.
come on!
it's on!
now see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time.
once i cave in, what can i fight?
i can never win, my self i don't like,
i don't like, i don't like, i don't like.
something is calling, i can't keep from falling.
come on!
it's on!
you see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time.
this time. this... time.
for me, inside. put me inside.
hold me, this time. put me inside.
come on!
it's on!


so you see i've gotten this far
please give me some place to hide
i'm not trying to go there, so take me away

life sometimes pisses me off
it's never a good trip for me
every time i reach for love, it's taken away

give me a sign, this is gay
give me some patience, so i pray
it's time to die, is that what i want?

there's nothing wrong wanting to be loved
is there something wrong with me?
for once in my life i'd like to be really set free

let me be me

give me a sign, this is gay
give me some guidance, so i pray
it's time to die, is that what i want?

take me away
taken away

take me away
taken away

something i get, i got to get home
run, run, run, run running home
where is my home?


give me a sign, this is gay
give me some patience, so i pray
it's time to die, is that what i want?

things they said when i was young
are quite enough to get me hung.

and ev'rything turns out gloomy.

some people count your money;
someone is countin' your days.
and somebody got to keep track of your mind
when ev'rything turns out gloomy.

brothers'll make you look sideways;
fathers'll make you look back.
and when you're done talking, you still got to shoot,
'cause ev'rything turns out gloomy.

ooh-ooh-ooh!
ooh-ooh-ooh!


i went for a walk
down by the river
near my home.
couldn't believe
with my own eyes,
and i swear i'll never leave
my home again.

i saw a man
walking on the water,
coming right at me
from the other side,
calling out my name
do not be afraid.
feet begin to run,
pounding in my brain.

i don't want to go;
no, i don't want to go.
no, no, no, no, no and no,
i don't want to go,

but lord, that ain't no fun.
better you grab it when she ain't lookin',
'cause you know you'd rather have it on the run.

clearwater!
revival!


bootleg, bootleg, bootleg, howl.
bootleg, bootleg, bootleg, howl.

take you a glass of water;
make it against the law.
see how good the water tastes,
when you can't have any at all.

findin' a natural woman,
like honey to a bee.
but you don't buzz the flower
when you know the honey's free.

suzy maybe give you some cherry pie,
but lord, that ain't no fun.
better you grab it when she ain't lookin',
'cause you know you'd rather have it on the run.


now when i was just a little boy, standin' to my daddy's knee
my poppa said, "son, don't let the man get you, do what he done to me.
'cause he'll get you
'cause he'll get you now, now."

and i can remember the fourth of july
runnin' through the backwoods bare
and i can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
chasin' down a hoodoo there
chasin' down a hoodoo there

born on the bayou
born on the bayou

yoh, yoh

wish i was back on the bayou
rollin' with some cajun queen
wishin' i were a fast freight train
just a-chooglin' on down to new orleans

a-let me remember things i love, lord
stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

i can hear the bullfrog callin' me home
wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, ho
love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water
shoo, fly, dragonfly, get back, you mother
pick up a flat rock; skip it across green river
well!

up at cody's camp i spent my days, lord
with flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers
old cody junior took me over
said, "you're gonna find the world be smolderin'
and if you get a-lost, come on home to green river"
well!

come on home


traffic in the city
turns my head around,
no, no, no, no, no.

you know, i ain't tied down.
ain't no sand in my pocket,

don't you waste my time.

and he was looking for you-know-who
he said, "hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow

well i used to wake the morning before the rooster crowed
searchin' for soda bottles to get myself some dough
brought 'em down to the corner, down to the country store
cash 'em in and give my money to a man named curtis loew

old curt was a black man with white curly hair
when he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
he used to own an old dobro, used to play it 'cross his knees
i'd give old curt my money, he'd play all day for me

play me a song curtis loew, curtis loew
well i got your drinkin' money, tune up your dobro
people said he was useless, them people all were fools
'cause curtis loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues

he looked to be sixty, and maybe i was ten
mama used to whup me but i'd go see him again
i'd clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
he'd play me a song or two then take another drink of wine

play me a song curtis loew, curtis loew
well i got your drinkin' money, tune up your dobro
people said he was useless, them people all were fools
'cause curtis loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
yes sir

on the day old curtis died nobody came to pray
ol' preacher said some words, and they chucked him in the clay
but he lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues
and on the day he lost his life, that's all he had to do

play me a song curtis loew, hey curtis loew
i wish that you was here so everyone would know
people said you were useless, them people all were fools
'cause curtis you're the finest picker to ever play the blues

it seems that all the friends i've got, just got to come, interrogate me
well, i appreciate your feelings and i don't want to pass you by
but i don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

well, its true i love the money and i love my brand new car
i like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playin' in a honky tonk bar
but when i come off the road, well, i just got to have my time
'cause i got to find a break in this action, else i'm gonna lose my mind

so, don't ask me no questions
and i won't tell you no lies
so, don't ask me about my business
and i won't tell you goodbye

that's right

well, "what's your favorite color and do you dig the brothers"
is drivin' me up a wall
and every time i think i can sleep, some fool has got to call
well, don't you think that when i come home
i just want a little peace of mind
and if you want to talk about the business buddy, you just are wastin' time

so, don't ask me no questions
and i won't tell you no lies
so, don't ask me about my business
and i won't tell you goodbye

i said, don't ask no stupid questions
and i won't send you away
if you want to talk fishin'
well, i guess that'll be okay


like a resstless leaf,
in the autumn breeze, once i was a tumbleweed,
like a rolling stone cold all alone,
living for the day my dream would come,
never cared for school, or any golden rules,
papa used to all ways say i was a useless fool,
so i left my home to show him they was wrong,
and headed out on the road singing my song,
then one sunny day, the man he looked my way,
and everything i dreamed of it was real,
money, girls and cars, and big long cigars
and i caught the first plane home so papa could see...

when i went home to show him they was wrong,
all that i found was two tombstones,
somebody tell me please was i right or wrong,
woa it's such a sad song
first i got lost then i got found,
but the ones that i love were in the ground,
papa i only wish you could see me now,
take a listen papa...
ooh i learned how to play my guitar,
gunna be a superstar

*instrumental*

...play one for mama now

*instrumental*

first i got lost, then i got found,
the ones that i loved were in the ground,
won't you tell me please was i right or wrong?

if there is any way, you can hear what i say,
papa i never meant to do ya no wrong,
all the money, girls, and cars, and all the world's big long cigars,
papa i just want you to know they couldn't take your place...

when i went home to show them they was wrong,
all that i found was a two tombstones,
sombody tell me please was i right or wrong,
lord it's such a sad song
first i got lost,
then i got found,
the ones that i loved were in the ground,
somebody tell me please was i right or wrong,

i jumped off a boxcar down around tennessee
i was cold tired and dirty hungry as i could be
but i had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs
so i asked the policeman
can i stay here long
he said mr. hobo you got to go now
we don't want you around
see i'm trying to build a respectable town
and we don't need a hobo like you hanging around

so i left that town, lord with my guitar in my hand
still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man
but this life that i chose to live, sometime's strange
see i'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the train
i'm a hobo i know, but that's the price i pay
guess i'll write me another song while i'm on my way
catch me another train and this is what i'll say
mr choo-choo train take me away

i'm goin' to ride this train lord until i find out
what jimmie rogers and the hag was all about
see i play this rock 'n' roll and i think that's fine
but i wnta to go back a little further in time
i'm a hobo i know but that's the price i pay
guess i'll write me another song while i'm on my way
catch me another train and this is what i'll say
mr choo-choo train take me away



new york city is a thousand miles away
and if you ask me, i'll tell you that's ok
now i'm not trying to put the big apple down
'cause they don't need a man like me in town
i pick cotton down on the dixie line
work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
but that's all right, that's ok by me
'cause that's the way that it was meant to be

big city, hard times don't bother me
i'm a country boy, i'm as happy as i can be

i don't like smoke chokin' up my air
and some of those city folks well they don't care
i don't like cars buzzing around
i don't even want a piece of concrete in my town
i like sunshine, fresh clean air
makes me feel like you wouldn't care but
that's all right, each to his own
but one smell from the city
and this country boy is gone
big city, hard times don't bother me
i'm a country boy, i'm as happy as i can be

well, i don't want to even read about it

let me tell you something, let me tell you true
what's right for me might not be right for you
well, you live your way, i'll live mine
and i hope that your happy all the time
i pick cotton down on the dixie line
work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
but that's all right, that's ok by me
'cause that's the way that it was supposed to be


big city, hard times never bother me
i'm a country boy, i'm as happy as i can be

let me tell ya, ... i said
big city, hard times never bother me
i'm a country boy, i'm as happy as i can be

two things you should know
and in these two things you must take pride
that's a horse and woman, yeah

i recall when i used to come home never had a dime
but lord i always had a good time
and i recall drinkin' wine with one of my friends
lord, i can't go back again

am i losin' my own way back home
am i losin' a good friend that i've known
am i losin' won't you tell me how i've sinned
why am i losin one of my bets friends

and i recall this friend of mine i knew so well
it goes to show lord you just can't tell
now my friend won't talk to me let me tell you why
he thinks i 've changed because of a dollar sign

and it's so strange when you get just a little money
your so called friends want to act just a little funny
they'll blame you

but i'm not the one that's here to blame
it's you my friend that's really changed
it's a shame, such a shame
am i losin' once again

why these things happen, lord i don't understand
but lord it can sure hurt a man
why my friend won't take me as i am
'cause your friend lord is the most important thing


i'm reckless and feelin' no pain
you know i've got no need to control
livin' with the danger
i'm always on the edge now
with million dollar visions that i hold
livin' like this never ever
tore my life apart
i know how to maintain
and you know i know my part

on a holiday, a permanent vacation
i'm living on a cigarette with wine
i'm never alone 'cause i've got myself
yes, i imitate myself all of the time

livin' like this never ever
tore my life apart
i know how to maintain
'cause it's comin' from my heart

i lead a reckless life
and i don't need your advice
i lead a reckless life
and you know it's my only vice

reckless life
i lead a reckless life
i lead a reckless life
and you know it's my only...

reckless life
i lead a reckless life
i lead a reckless life
and you know it's my only...

she hit town like a rose in bloom
smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
the color faded and the petals died
down in the city, no one cried
in the streets, the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
they moved in and made a tenement home

i said nice boys
don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
i'm not a nice boy!

sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
wanted so bad to be part of the scene
she met the man and she did the smack
paid the price layin' flat on her back
wanted so bad just to please the boys
they ended up just being a toy
played so hard burned her life away
lies were told no promises made

you know nice boys
don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
i'm not a nice boy and i never was!

young and fresh when she hit town
hot for kicks just to get around
but now she lays in a filthy room
she kills the pain with
a flick and a spoon
and in the streets the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
you know the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
moved in and made a tenement home

nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby

nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll

reminds me of childhood memories
where everything was as fresh
as the bright blue sky

now and then when i see her face
she takes me away to that special place
and if i stare too long
i'd probably break down and cry

woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

she's got eyes of the bluest skies
and if they thought of rain
i'd hate to look into those eyes
and see an ounce of pain

her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
where as a child i'd hide
and pray for the thunder and the rain
to quietly pass me by

woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

oh oh yeah
woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

she hit town like a rose in bloom
smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
the color faded and the petals died
down in the city, no one cried
in the streets, the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
they moved in and made a tenement home

i said nice boys
don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
i'm not a nice boy!

sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
wanted so bad to be part of the scene
she met the man and she did the smack
paid the price layin' flat on her back
wanted so bad just to please the boys
they ended up just being a toy
played so hard burned her life away
lies were told no promises made

you know nice boys
don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
i'm not a nice boy and i never was!

young and fresh when she hit town
hot for kicks just to get around
but now she lays in a filthy room
she kills the pain with
a flick and a spoon
and in the streets the garbage lies
protected by a million flies
you know the roaches so big
you know that they got bones
moved in and made a tenement home

nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll
nice boys don't play rock and roll

she's got her halo and wings
hidden under his eyes
but she's an angel for sure
she just can't stop telling lies

but it's too late for his love
already caught in a trap
his angel's kiss was a joke
and she is not coming back

because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
keep him tied to a dream
and only she can set him free

and then he says to me
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

yeah, she's got a criminal mind
he's got a reason to pray
his life is under the gun
he's got to hold everyday

now he just wants to wake up
yeah, just to prove it's a dream
'cause she's an angel for sure
but that remains to be seen

because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
keep him tied to a dream
and only she can set him free

and then he says to me
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

stupid on the streets of london
james dean in the rain
and without her, it's not the same
but it's alright

because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
they keep him tied up to a dream
and only she can set him free

and then he says to me
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

kill me now
kill me now
kill me now
kill me now

again and again


send me away, oh

comin' out of my cage
and i've been doin' just fine
gotta gotta be down
because i want it all

it started out with a kiss
how did it end up like this?
it was only a kiss
it was only a kiss

now i'm falling asleep
and she's calling a cab
while he's havin' a smoke
and she's takin' a drag

now they're going to bed
and my stomach is sick
and it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now
he takes off her dress now
let me go

and i just can't look
it's killing me
and taking control

jealousy
turning saints into the sea
swimming through sick lullabies
choking on your alibis
but it's just the price i pay
destiny is calling me
open up my eager eyes
'cause i'm mr. brightside

i'm comin' out of my cage

pick you up, later on
what to do? it doesn't matter
'cause you get what you want
through and through and if you shatter
everything that we've got
will you call me on occasion?
if you like it or not, oh no

so turn it up, take me down
from the wall, it doesn't matter
'cause you get what you want
after all and now you've shattered
everything that we had
and you call me on occasion
just to see how i am
i'm hanging in

but now time teaches me
to pretend it doesn't matter
'cause you get what you want
in the end and now you've shattered everything
he looks a bit like me

replaceable
it's cynical
call me useless, just you wait
put me down and call it fate
broken bridges, wasted hate
so just stand beside your man
the boy ain't wrong
act like i never turned you on
all i do is cry

december finds you all alone
you call me on the telephone
who'd have thought that you'd regret
all those evil things you said
now as friends, we say goodbye
i think there's something in my eye

replaceable
it's cynical
call me useless, just you wait
put me down and call it fate
broken bridges, wasted hate
so just stand beside your man
the boy ain't wrong
act like i never turned you on
all i do is cry

and you watched me die at least a thousand times
but it's great to hear you're doing fine
but you've got inside this naive head of mine
now time goes by
you knew you would
you knew you would
i need to understand
replaceable


we had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
she said she loved me but she had somewhere to go
she couldn't scream while i held her close
i swore i'd never let her go

tell me what you wanna know
oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
there ain't no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
so come on, oh come on, oh come on

i know my rights, i've been here all day and it's time
for me to go so let me know if it's all right
i just can't take this, i swear i told you the truth
she couldn't scream while i held her close
i swore i never let her go

tell me what you wanna know
oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
and then you whisper in my ear
"i know what you're doing here"
so come on, oh come on, oh come on

there ain't no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
oh come on, oh come on, oh come on

remember rio and get down
like some other dj in some other town
she's been trying to tell me to hold tight

but i've been down
across a road or two
but now i've found
the velvet sun that shines on me and you

in the back, uh huh
i can't crack, we're on top
it's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
i can't fake, we're on top, we're on top

the day is breaking, we're still here
your body's shaking and it's clear
you really need it, so let go
and let me beat it, but you know

that i've been down
across the road or two
but now i've found
the velvet sun that shines on me and you

in the back, uh huh
i can't crack, we're on top
it's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
i can't fake, we're on top, we're on top

we bring the bump to the grind, uh huh
i don't mind, we're on top
it's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
i can't fake, we're on top, we're on top


it's like a cigarette in the mouth
or a handshake in the doorway
i look at you and smile because i'm fine


it's like a cigarette in the mouth
or a handshake in the doorway
i look at you and smile because i'm fine


racy days help me through the hopeless haze
but my, oh my
tragic eyes, i can't even recognize myself
behind

so, if the answer is no
can i change your mind?

out again, a siren screams at half past ten
and you won't let go
while i ignore that we both felt like this before
it starts to show

so, if i have a chance
would you let me know?

why aren't you shaking?
step back in time
graciously taking
oh, you're too kind

and if the answer is no
can i change your mind?

we're all the same
and love is blind
the sun is gone
before it shines

and i said if the answer is no
can i change your mind?
if the answer is no
can i change your mind?


i know what you want
if you can keep a secret
i got a blanket in the backseat on my mind

and a little place that sits beneath the sky
she turned her face to speak but no one heard her cry

drive faster, boy
drive faster, boy

i know there's a hope
there's too many people trying to help me cope
you got a real short skirt
i wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah yeah

we were just in time
let me take a little more off your mind
there's something in my head
somewhere in the backseat
we were just a good thing
we were such a good thing

make it go away without a word
but promise me you'll stay and fix these things i've heard

make it go away, oh
drive faster, boy

the crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
with jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
i took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
of stars and atmosphere and watched her disappear

faster, faster, faster
faster, faster, faster
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no

if you can keep a secret
well, baby, i can keep
if you can keep a secret

across a road or two
but now i've found
the velvet sun that shines on me and you

glamorous indie rock and roll is what i want

a coffee shop with a cause

i know what you want
if you can keep a secret
i got a blanket in the backseat on my mind

and a little place that sits beneath the sky
she turned her face to speak but no one heard her cry

drive faster, boy
drive faster, boy

i know there's a hope
there's too many people trying to help me cope
you got a real short skirt
i wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah yeah

we were just in time
let me take a little more off your mind
there's something in my head
somewhere in the backseat
we were just a good thing
we were such a good thing

make it go away without a word
but promise me you'll stay and fix these things i've heard

make it go away, oh
drive faster, boy

the crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
with jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
i took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
of stars and atmosphere and watched her disappear

faster, faster, faster
faster, faster, faster
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no

if you can keep a secret

la la la la, oh ho
i wasn't shopping for a doll
to say the least, i'd thought i'd seen them all
then you took me by surprise
i'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes

i never knew, i never knew
so take your suitcase, 'cause i don't mind
and, babydoll, i meant it
every time

i'm not a rat to be spat upon
locked up in this room
those bars that look towards the sun

everyday the swallows play
in the clouds of love
make me wish that i had wings
take me high above

and i looked high
saw the empty sky
if i could only
could only fly

i'd drift with them
in endless space
but no man flies
from this place

and stare towards the stars
and home seems oh so far

if i could only swing
upon those twinkling dots above
i'd look down from the heavens
upon the ones i love

hey, the lucky locket
hangs around your precious neck
some luck i ever got with you
and i wouldn't like to bet

that sooner or later you'll own
just one half of this land
by shining your eyes on the wealth
of every man

just send up my love
ain't seen nothing but tears
now i've got myself
in this room for years


the seadogs have all sailed their ships
into the docks of dawn
while the sirens sit and comb their hair
and twiddle with their thumbs

oh thor above the mountain
look down upon your children
this is their heaven where they're told
to bring their galleons

seek you find your place with me
men of iron, men of steel
only the brave hear the hammers ring
in the courts of the queens, in the halls of the kings

you can come to val-hala in your own time
come to val-hala seek and you will find val-hala
come to val-hala in your own time
come to val-hala seek and you will find val-hala

there's long boats in the harbor
which arrive there every hour
with the souls of the heroes
whose blood lies on the flowers

and this heaven is the home
of every man who loves his sword
and he uses it for freedom
to preach the word of thor


it's hard to feel what's in your head
where the gas lamps grow
and the garbage blows
around the paper stands

and a baby cried
and i saw a light
and i wondered where
and i wondered why
there'd be a loss of life

down on western ford gateway
that's a place where the dead say
that a man lives no more
that his fair share of days
down on western ford gateway

it flowed upon the cobbled floor
for the bottle's dead
and they're drunk again
by the tavern door


she chose the soft center
and took it to bed with her mother
and the ideal confusion
was just an illusion
to gain further news of her brother

and the comfort of mother
was just an appeal for protection
for the cat from next door
was found later at four
in surgical dissection

and i don't want to be
the son of any freak
who for a chocolate center
can take you off the street

for soon they'll plough the desert
and god knows where i'll be
collecting submarine numbers
on the main street of the sea

the vicar is thicker
and i just can't see through to him
for his cardinal sings
a collection of hymns
and a collection of coins is made after

and who wrote the bible
was it judas or pilate
well one cleans his hands
while the other one hangs
but still i continue to stand


look up little brother
can you see the clover
no not over there
a little bit left and over there

now look and see the lilac tree
the lily pond, the skylark's song
the open air but no one cares
if branches live and die out there

remember when you were nine
and i was ten
we would run into the woods
no we never will again

and lady, what's tomorrow
what's tomorrow anyway
if it's not the same as now
it's the same as yesterday

yes lady, what's tomorrow
will it be the same as now
will the farmer push the pen
will the writer pull the plough

look up little brother
can you see the clover
oh sorry but it's over
now there's concrete and no clover


i viewed in my presence
my hand on my forehead
and sighting the liners
of mad merchant seamen
in search of the living
or the spices of china

lucy walked gently
between the damp barrels
and shut out my eyes
with the width of her fingers
said she'd guessed the number
of bales in the back room

while the seagulls were screaming
lucy was eating
then we hauled up our colors
the way the mother had told us
and together we just watched the sails

lucy i said
in a passage of cotton kegs
can we hold hands
i'm sure that it's warmer
then the gulls ate the crumbs
of lucy's sandwich


in orient where wise i was
to please the way i live
come give the beggar chance at hand
his life is on his lip

three score a thousand times
where once in amazon
where eldorado holds the key
no keeper holds my hand

unchain the gate of solitude
the ruler says you run
run hard unto the scaffold high
your chance to jump the gun

oh how high the scaffold grows
the plant life of your widow
in black lace curtains brought you near
from out the plate glass window

the minotaur with bloody hands
is enraged by the sun
caged he by the corpses
brought forth by the dawn

in orient is as i told
the buckshee hangman swears
for open crypts to silence
nylon knots to sway by prayer

in orient where wise i was
to please the way i live
come give the beggar chance at hand
his life is on his lip


turn me loose from your hands
let me fly to distant lands
over green fields, trees and mountains
flowers and forest fountains
home along the lanes of the skyway

for this dark and lonely room
projects a shadow cast in gloom
and my eyes are mirrors
of the world outside
thinking of the way
that the wind can turn the tide
and these shadows turn
from purple into grey

for just a skyline pigeon
dreaming of the open
waiting for the day
he can spread his wings
and fly away again
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
you've left so very far behind
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
you've left so very far behind

just let me wake up in the morning
to the smell of new mown hay
to laugh and cry, to live and die
in the brightness of my day

i want to hear the pealing bells
of distant churches sing
but most of all please free me
from this aching metal ring
and open out this cage towards the sun

for just a skyline pigeon
dreaming of the open
waiting for the day
he can spread his wings
and fly away again
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
you've left so very far behind
fly away skyline pigeon fly
towards the dreams
you've left so very, so very far behind


gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
his watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
and the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
but the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
as the sheep that he locked in the pen

there's four feet of ground in front of the barn
that's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
but now it lies empty so cold and so bare
gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

by passing the doors of his life was a stage i remember
and in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
for sentiment touched him as cyclamen holds him
and later men came from the town
who said clear the child this won't take a while
and gulliver's gone with the dawn


when the shrill winds are screaming
and the evening is still
lady samantha glides over the hill
in a long satin dress that she wears every day
her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave

lady samantha glides like a tiger
over the hills with no one beside her
no one comes near
they all live in fear
but lady samantha, she sheds only tears

are out of proportion and none of them right
she is harmless and empty of anything bad
for she once had something that most of you have


the sister of sunlight
comes to my lonely life
bearing the crosses i hung
i hung on my lonely wife
and the anchor told me
if i prayed by the river
that the sweet sound of water
would always go with her

all across the havens to the waterfall
they told me i would meet her there
inside those icy walls
but how on earth in this universe
can they forgive me of my pains
for all across the havens
i must stumble locked in chains

then the mother of mercy
showed me her stable
and told me you would be safe
safe in her cradle
and the waterfall opened
and the water withdrew
leaving me standing
on a road leading through


hey there
look in the mirror
are you afraid you might see me looking at you
waiting, waiting at windows
oh it's me that you need
yes it's me and i'm waiting for you

but i remain silent
oh i won't say a word
i leave you to realise i'm the light in your world
and it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
that you're needing
it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
that you need
yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
if you want to be living
i'm the one who's forgiving
admit that it's me that you need

watching, watching the swallows fly
it all means the same
just like them
you can fly home again
but don't, no don't forget yesterday
pride is an ugly word girl
and you still know my name


i looked up from my glass into the sky
there's no one in my comic book to buy
calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away

so stop in the sky and tell me why
you're changing your colours before my eyes
yellow, blue, green and grey
settled on the window pane

it made the rain that came seem strange
just like strange rain
it made the rain that came seem strange
just like strange rain

still i sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
come in colours from above into my citadel
my eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
and now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain


it's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
i'm not one of those who can easily hide
i don't have much money, but, boy if i did
i'd buy a big house where we both could live

if i was a sculptor, but then again, no
or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
i know it's not much but it's the best i can do
my gift is my song and this one's for you

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
but the sun's been quite kind, while i wrote this song
it's for people like you that keep it turned on

so excuse me forgetting, but these things i do
you see i've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
anyway, the thing is, what i really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes i've ever seen

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world


you're not a ship to carry my life
i've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
for i need your love. your love protects my fears.

and i wonder sometimes, and i know i'm unkind,
but i need you to turn to when i act so blind.
oh i need you to turn to when i lose control
you're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.

did you paint your smile on when i said i knew
that my reason for living was for loving you
we're related in feeling, but you're high above
you're pure and you're gentle, with the grace of a dove.

and i wonder sometimes, and i know i'm unkind,
but i need you to turn to when i act so blind.
oh i need you to turn to when i lose control
you're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.


if you feel that it's real i'm on trial
and i'm here in your prison
like a coin in your mint
i am dented and i'm spent with high treason

through a glass eye your throne
is the one danger zone
take me to the pilot for control
take me to the pilot of your soul

take me to the pilot
lead me through the chamber
take me to the pilot
i am but a stranger

take me to the pilot
lead me through the chamber
take me to the pilot
i am but a stranger

well i know he's not old
and i'm told, and i'm told he's a virgin
for he may be she
what i'm told is never, never for certain

through a glass eye your throne
is the one danger zone
take me to the pilot for control
take me to the pilot of your soul, yeah, yeah

take me to the pilot
lead me through the chamber
take me to the pilot
i am but a stranger

take me to the pilot
lead me through the chamber

i was one as you were one
and we were two so much in love forever
i loved the white socks that you wore
but you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
i joked about your turned-up nose
and criticized your school girl clothes
but would i then have paced these roads to love you
for seasons come and seasons go
bring forth the rain the sun and snow
make valerie a woman
and valerie is lonely

no more to roam on the snow hills of hienton
undecided with the guardians of the older generation
a doormat was a sign of welcome
in the winter months to come
and in the summer laughing
through the castle ruins we'd run

for the quadrangle sang to the sun
and the grace of our feeling
and the candle burned low as we talked of the future
underneath the ceiling
there were tears in the sky
and the clouds in your eyes were just cover
for your thighs were the cushions
of my love and yours for each other
the songs still are sung
it was fun to be young
but please don't be sad where 'ere you are

i am who i am
you are who you are
now valerie's a woman
now valerie's a woman
now valerie's a woman


holy moses i have been removed
i have seen the specter he has been here too
distant cousin from down the line
brand of people who ain't my kind
holy moses i have been removed

holy moses i have been deceived
now the wind has changed direction and i'll have to leave
won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
holy moses i have been deceived

i'm going back to the border
where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
i can't take any more bad water
i've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes

holy moses i have been deceived
holy moses let us live in peace
let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
there's a man over there what's his color i don't care
he's my brother let us live in peace
he's my brother let us live in peace
he's my brother let us live in peace


peering out of tiny eyes
the grubby hands that gripped the rail
wiped the window clean of frost
as the morning air laid on the latch
a whistle awakened someone there
next door to the nursery just down the hall
a strange new sound you never heard before
the strange new sound that make boys explore
tread neat so small those little feet
amid the morning his small heart beats
so much excitement yesterday
that must be rewarded. must be displayed.

large hands lift him through the air
excited eyes contain him there
the eyes of those he loves and knows
but what's this extra bed just here
his puzzled head tipped to one side
amazement swims in those bright green eyes
glancing down upon this thing
that makes strange sounds. strange sounds that sing.

in those silent happy seconds
that surround the sound of this event
a parent smile is made in moments
they have made for you a friend
and all you ever learned from them
until you grew much older
did not compare with when they said
this is your brand new brother.
this is your brand new brother.
this is your brand new brother, la la la la la la...


have you ever lived in a cage
where you live to be whipped and be tamed
for i've never loved in a cage
or talked to a friend or just waved

well i walk while they talk about virtue
just raised on my back legs and snarled
watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
and tell dirty jokes as he died

but i'm damned when i really care there
for the cellar's the room in your lives
where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
and close the cage doors on your life

well i pray while you bathe in bad water
sing songs that i learnt as a boy
then break all the bones in my body
on the bars you can never destroy


no man's a jester playing shakespeare
round your throne room floor
while the juggler's act is danced upon
the crown that you once more

and sooner or later
everybody's kingdom must end
and i'm so afraid your courtiers
cannot be called best friends

caesar's had your troubles
widows have to cry
while mercenaries in cloisters sing
and the king must die

some men are better staying sailors
take my word and go
but tell the ostler that his name was
the very first they chose

and if my hands are stained forever
and the altar should refuse me
would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in
should i cry sanctuary?

caesar's had your troubles
widows have to cry
while mercenaries in cloisters sing
and the king must die

yeah, the king must die
the king must die, oh yeah

no man's a jester playing shakespeare
round your throne room floor
while the juggler's act is danced upon
the crown that you once more

the king is dead, the king is dead
the king is dead, the king is dead
long live the king


it seems as though i've lived my life
on the bad side of the moon
to stir your dregs in sickness still
without the rustic spoon

common people live with me
where the light has never shone
and the hermits flock like hummingbirds
to speak in a foreign tongue

i'm a light world away
from the people who make me stay
sitting on the bad side of the moon

there ain't no need for watchdogs here
to justify our ways
we live our life in manacles
the main cause of our stay

exiled here from other worlds
my sentence comes too soon
why should i be made to pay
on the bad side of the moon


why's it never light on my lawn
why does it rain and never say good day to the new dawn
on the big screen they showed us a sun
but not as bright in life as the real one
it's never quite the same as the real one

and tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
to see through eyes that only see what's real
tell me grey seal

i never learned why meteors were formed
i only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
if anyone can cry then so can i
i read books and draw life from the eye
all my life is drawings from the eye

and tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
to see through eyes that only see what's real
tell me grey seal

your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
the roots were formed by twisted roots
your roots were twisted then
i was reborn before all life could die
the phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
if the phoenix bird can fly then so can i

and tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise
to see through eyes that only see what's real
tell me grey seal

tell me grey seal how does it feel
tell me grey seal how does it feel
tell me grey seal how does it feel


if anyone should see me making it down the highway
breaking all the laws of the land
well don't you try to stop me
i'm going her way
and that's the way i'm sure she had it planned

well that's my rock-and-roll madonna
she's always been a lady of the road
well everybody wants her
but no one ever gets her
well the freeway is the only way she knows

well if she would only slow down for a short time
i'd get to know her just before she leaves
but she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
and i swear it's going to be the death of me


it's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
i'm not one of those who can easily hide
i don't have much money, but, boy if i did
i'd buy a big house where we both could live

if i was a sculptor, but then again, no
or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
i know it's not much but it's the best i can do
my gift is my song and this one's for you

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
but the sun's been quite kind, while i wrote this song
it's for people like you that keep it turned on

so excuse me forgetting, but these things i do
you see i've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
anyway, the thing is, what i really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes i've ever seen

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world


you're not a ship to carry my life
i've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
for i need your love. your love protects my fears.

and i wonder sometimes, and i know i'm unkind,
but i need you to turn to when i act so blind.
oh i need you to turn to when i lose control
you're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.

did you paint your smile on when i said i knew
that my reason for living was for loving you
we're related in feeling, but you're high above
you're pure and you're gentle, with the grace of a dove.

and i wonder sometimes, and i know i'm unkind,
but i need you to turn to when i act so blind.
oh i need you to turn to when i lose control
you're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.


if you feel that it's real i'm on trial
and i'm here in your prison
like a coin in your mint
i am dented and i'm spent with high treason

through a glass eye your throne
is the one danger zone
take me to the pilot for control
take me to the pilot of your soul

take me to the pilot
lead me through the chamber
take me to the pilot
i am but a stranger

take me to the pilot
lead me through the chamber
take me to the pilot
i am but a stranger

well i know he's not old
and i'm told, and i'm told he's a virgin
for he may be she
what i'm told is never, never for certain

through a glass eye your throne

at my feeding time
she pushed food through the door
and i crawl towards the crack of light
sometimes i can't find my way
newspapers spread around soaking all that they can
a cleaning is due again, a good hosing down

the lady whom i feel maternal love for
can not look me in the eyes
but i see hers and they are blue
and they cock and twitch and masturbate

ah
i said so
i said so
i said so

black windows of paint i scratched with my nails
i see others just like me, why do they not try to escape?
they bring out the older ones, they point in my way
they come with a flash of light and take my family away

and very later i have learned to
accept some friends or ridicule
my whole existence is for your amusement
and that is why i'm here with you

to take
me with
you're right

they make a deal when they come to town

he loves her more than he will ever show

keep the cigarettes close to his heart
keeps her photographs close to her heart
keep the bitterness close to the heart

leaving the things that you love from mind
all of the things that you learned from fears
nothing is left for the years

voices scream
nothing seen
real's the dream

toys, toys, toys, in the attic
toys, toys, toys, in the attic
toys, toys, toys, in the attic
toys, toys, toys, in the attic

toys, toys, toys, we're in the attic
toys, toys, toys, we're in the attic
toys, toys, toys, in the attic
toys, toys, toys, in the attic

uncle salty told me stories of a lonely
baby with a lonely kinda life to lead
her mammy was lusted, daddy he was busted
they left her to be trusted 'til the orphan bleeds

uncle salty told me when she was just a baby
that she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see
but soon she found her mother's love for all the others
the pushers and the shovers, was the life to lead

oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooooh, oh yeah
ooooh, oh yeah-ha-ha

now she's doin' any for money and a penny
a sailor with a penny or two or three
her's is the cunnin' for men who come a-runnin'
they all come for fun and it seems to me

ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window


back when cain was able, way before the stable
lightnin' struck right down from the sky
a mother ship with fate said, "let's give it a try"
conscience was related, man he was created
lady luck took him by surprise
a sweet and bitter fruit, it surely opened his eyes

well she ate it
lordy, it was love at first bite
well she ate it
never knowin' wrong from right, right, right, right

even eve in eden
voices tried deceivin'
with lies that showed the lady the way
at first she stopped and turned and tried to walk away
man he was believer, lady was deceiver
so the story goes, but you see
the snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree

so she ate it
lordy, it was love at first bite
well she ate it
never knowin' wrong from right, right, right

conscience was related, man he was created
lady luck took him by surprise
the sweet and bitter fruit, is sure to open his eyes

evil came like rainin', who knows who's complainin'
somethin' tried to lay her to waste
and all she want and need was just a little taste

whoa, she ate it
lordy, it was love at first bite
well she ate it
never knowin' wrong from right, right, right

well she ate it
lordy, it was love at first bite
yeah she ate it
never knowin' wrong from right, right
oh, that's right


backstroke lover, always hidin' 'neath the covers
'til i talked to my daddy, he say
he said "you ain't seen nothin'
til' you're down on a muffin
then you're sure to be a-changin' your way"

i met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
oh, the times i could reminisce
'cause the best things of lovin'
with her sister and her cousin
only started with a little kiss, like this

seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
and your feet flyin' up in the air
singin' "hey, diddle diddle" with your kitty in the middle
of the swing like i didn't care
so i took a big chance
at the high school dance
with a missy who was ready to play
was it me she was foolin'?
'cause she knew what she was doin'
then i knowed love was here to stay

when she told me to
walk this way, walk this way
walk this way, walk this way
walk this way, walk this way
walk this way, walk this way
just gimme a kiss!

like this
ooh
uh

school girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
there was three young ladies in the school gym locker
when i noticed they was lookin' at me
i was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
till the boys told me somethin' i missed
then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
so i gave her just a little kiss, like this

seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
and your feet flyin' up in the air
a-sing "hey, diddle diddle" with your kitty in the middle
of the swing like i didn't care
so i took a big chance
at the high school dance
with a missy who was ready to play
was it me she was foolin'?
'cause she knew what she was doin'
when she told me how to walk this way

she told me to
walk this way, talk this way
walk this way, walk this way
walk this way, walk this way

but i really get her going
when i get out my big ten inch

record of a band that plays the blues
well, a band that plays the blues
she just love my big ten inch
record of her favorite blues

now now hey

i gave my love a little pinch
she said, "now stop that jivin'.

and when we're in a lover's clinch
she gets all excited
when she begs for my big ten inch

record of a band that plays the blues

she just love my big ten inch
record of her favorite blues


sweet emotion
sweet emotion

you talk about things and nobody cares
you're wearing out things that nobody wears
you're calling my name but i gotta make clear
i can't say, baby, where i'll be in a year

some sweat-hog mama with a face like a gent
said my get up and go must have got up and went
well i got good news she's a real good liar
'cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

sweet emotion
sweet emotion

i pulled into town in a police car
your daddy said i took it just a little too far
you tell enough things but your girlfriend lied
you can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
a-yes it did

standing in the front just a-shaking your ass
i take you backstage you can drink from my glass
i talk about something you can sure understand
'cause a month on the road and i'll be eating from your hand


blood stains the ivories on my daddy's baby grand
ain't seen the daylight since we started this band

store bought clothes fallin' 'part at the seams
tea leaf readin' gypsies fortune tellin' my dreams

holiday inn, lock the daughter with a chain
you love 'em and you hate it but to me they're all the same

baby i'm a dreamer, found my horse and carriage

stalemate, jailbait, ladies can't refuse
you love 'em then you leave 'em with your sold-out reviews

sweet talkin' barroom lady's disease
slippin' with her lips slidin' down your knees

me 'n my life a screamer
bound to a wife 'n marriage
baby i'm a dreamer, found my horse and carriage

ladies hold the aces on their lover's code of passion
the men call it pleasure but to me it's old fashioned
times they're a-changin' nothin' ever stands still
if i don't stop a-changin' i'll be writin' my will
it's the same old story, never get a second chance
for a dance to the top of the hill

baby i'm a dreamer, found my horse and carriage

i'm gettin' the strangest feelin' baby,  i can't remember my name
'cause the life i been livin' and the love someone give me

and always caught in the blaze of someone else's dreams, looky now everythin' changes, i ain't nothin' the same

peelin' off my boots and chaps, i'm saddle sore

fool's gold out of their mines, the girls are soaking wet
no tongue's drier than mine, i'll come when i get back

i'm back in the saddle again

i'm living back home

down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafras-y
can't stand up on my feet in the city
gotta get back to the real nitty gritty

yes sir, no sir
don't come close to my
home, sweet home
can't catch no dose
of my hot tail poontang sweetheart, sweathog
that makes ya a purse
from a j. paul getty and his ear
with her face in her beer

home sweet home

get out in the field put the mule in the stable
ma, she's a cookin' put the eats on the table
hate's in the city and my love's in the meadow
hand's on the plow and my feet's in the ghetto

stand up, sit down
don't do nothing
it ain't no good when boss man's
stuffin' down their throats
for paper notes
and their babies cry
while cities lie at their feet
when you're rockin' the streets

home sweet home

mama, take me home, sweet home
i was the last child
i'm just a punk in the street...


goin' under rats in the cellar
goin' under skin's turnin' yellow
nose is runny losin' my connection
losin' money gettin' no affection

new york city blues
east side west side blues
throw me in the slam
catch me if you can
believe
that you're wearin'
tearin' me apart

safe complaining 'cause everything's rotten
go insanin' and ain't a thing forgotten
feelin' cozy rats in the cellar
cheeks are rosy skin's turning yellow
loose and soggy lookin' rather lazy
see my body pushin' up the daisies

new york city's dues
east side west side news
throw me in the slam
a catch me if you can
believe
that you're wearin'
tearin' me apart

new york city blues
east side west side blues
throw me in the slam
a catch me if you can
believe
that you're wearin'
tearin' me apart


the street is cold the dawn is gray
my heart says no but my head says stay
my work is finished or so i've been told
you can't part the three of us once we got a hold

i forgot my name
i took a shot on the chin
i'm rearranging my game
tell by the shape i'm in

in the line of fire you know what to say
they gave us no choices just one shade of gray
my legs keep moving don't seem to stray
but i know each step we take they're one step away

i found the secret the key to the vault
we walked in darkness kept hittin' the walls
i took the time to feel for the door
i found the secret the key to it all

i got the nouveauree
and dragged it home to bed
i traded you for me
i took it all and said

i find my own fun sometimes for free
i got to pay it to come lookin' for me
walking on gucci wearin' yves saint laurent
barely stay on 'cause i'm so god damn gaunt

i found the secret the key to the vault
we walked in darkness kept hittin' the walls
i took the time to feel for the door
i found the secret the key to it all


please i just got to talk to you
please a get'cha your head out of the loo
please and we're a long long way from home
please you'd turn a young man's face to stone

sick as a dog what's your story
sick as a dog a cat got your tongue
sick as a dog you'll be sorry
sick as a dog you're really ain't that young

please you were much to my surprise
please you're the lady in disguise
please you're the only a friend i got
please you'll be the last to see me rot

sick as a dog what's your story
sick as a dog uum... cat got your tongue
sick as a dog you'll be sorry
sick as a dog 'cause ya really ain't that young

please it's a shame you're so refined
please you was the last thing on my mind
please don't be late to take it light

sick as a dog what's your story

hey there, looking at me
tell me, what do you see?
but you quickly turn your head away

try to find the words i could use
don't have the courage to come up to you
my chance is looking a bit gray

staring across the room
are you leaving soon?
i just need a little time

what is it that drives me mad?
girls like you that i never had
what is it about you that i adore?

what makes me feel so much pain
that makes me go so insane?
what is it about you that i adore?

staring across the room
are you leaving soon?
i just need a little time

why did you have to leave so soon?
why did you have to walk away?

oh well, it happened again
she walked away with her boyfriend
maybe we'll meet again someday

maybe we'll meet again someday
maybe we'll meet again someday
someday


i'll go for miles until i find you
you say you want to leave me but you can't choose
i feel my mind is going insane, something i can't fight

don't leave me
don't leave me
don't leave me
don't leave me

a blank expression covering your face
i'm looking for directions to get out of this place
i start to wonder if you'll come back
i feel the rain storming after thunder, i can't hold back

don't leave me
don't leave me
don't leave me
don't leave me


looking back upon my life and the places that i've been
the pictures, faces, girls i've loved, i try to remember when
faded memories on the wall, some names i have forgotten
but each one is a memory i look back on so often

i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there, i was there
i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there, i was there

looking back, what i have done, there's lots more left to live
at times i feel overwhelmed, i question what i can give
but i don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
there's no doubt about who i am, i always have tomorrow

i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there, i was there
i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there, i was there

looking back upon my life
faded memories upon the wall
looking now at who i am, who am i?
i don't let it get me down

looking back upon my life and the places that i've been
the pictures, faces, girls i've loved, i try to remember when
but i don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
there's no doubt about who i am, i always have tomorrow

i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there, i was there
i looked into the past and i want to make it last
i was there, i was there


now you see me, now you don't, don't ask me where i'm at
'cause i'm a million miles away
treated like a forbidden heel, don't say my thoughts are not for real
or you won't see me again

am i here or am i there?
or am i playing on the stairs?
am i in my room with my toys?
i am the disappearing boy

when i walk in crowded rooms, i feel as if it is my doom
i know that i don't belong
in that room i see her, i see her and she's with him
i turn around and then i'm gone

don't call me up 'cause i'm not home
my whereabouts are now unknown
i vanished from all your joy
i am the disappearing boy

i have my doubts of where i belong
it's something to think about

don't call me up 'cause i'm not home
my whereabouts are now unknown
i vanished from all your joy
i am the disappearing boy


a small cloud has fallen, the white mist hits the ground
my lungs comfort me with joy
vegging on one detail, the rest just crowds around
my eyes itch of burning red

picture sounds
of moving insects, so surreal
lay around
looks like i found something new

laying in my bed, i think i'm in left field
i picture someone, i think it's you
you're standing so damn close my body begins to swell
why does one and one make two?

here we go again, infatuation touches me
just when i thought that it would end
oh, but then again, it seems much more than that
but i'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

but to find that it's not different at all
well, i throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
that's when i say "what the hey?"

would it last forever?
you and i together, hand and hand, we run away, far away
i'm in for nasty weather
but i'll take whatever you can give that comes my way, far away

of getting older and older all the time
i ask you now, what does this mean?
are all these problems just in my mind?

things are easy when you're a child
but now these pressures are dropped on my head
the length i've gone are just long miles
would they be shorter if i were dead?

every time i look in my past
i always wish i was there
i wish my youth would forever last
why are these times so unfair?

look at my friends and see what they've done
ask myself why they've had to change
i liked them better when they were young
now all these times are rearranged

i look down and stand there and cry
nothing will ever be the same
the sun is rising now, i ask why
the clouds are falling, here comes the rain

every time i look in my past
i always wish i was there
i wish my youth would forever last
why are these times so unfair?

i always waste my time just wondering
what the next man thinks of me
i'll never do exactly what i want
and i'll sculpt my life for your acceptance

i always waste my time just wondering
what the next man thinks of me
i'll never do exactly what i want
and i'll sculpt my life for your acceptance

and i feel forgotten, feel like rotting
do you feel the same, do you feel the same?
adolescence just can't make sense
it's calling my name, it's calling my name

i take a look around at all the things i've found
i call it blind hatred
if you'd stop awhile, and maybe if you'd smile
you would realize that we're all the same

it's just like a brain
when it goes insane
we feel the same pain

all my life i've seemed to have this need
i think at times it even turns to greed
we all want to join this family
we'll even sacrifice a moral changing

but i feel forgotten, feel like rotting
do you feel the same, do you feel the same?
adolescence just can't make sense
it's calling my name, it's calling my name

i take a look around at all the things i've found

hey, can you hear me? i'm calling your name
hello, or is this goodbye?
the gleam in your eyes, it troubles my brain
will i see it again?

so i can rest my head

angel, dancing away
as all of my thoughts get rearranged
angel, turning away
just when things seem to have changed

so i can rest my head

hey, can you hear me? i'm calling your name
hello, or is this goodbye?
the gleam in your eyes, it troubles my brain
will i see it again?

so i can rest my head


princess in a schoolgirl's dream, may i please speak to you?
i'm having troubles with control and it's all because of you
today i kept on falling down, i thought it was the street
and so i looked down at my shoes, they were on the wrong feet

and i find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
and i do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
you're the one i wish i had and now my girlfriend's getting mad
i cannot call this sane, i cannot call this sane

today as i was walking down, you bumped into me
you said "excuse me" and walked away as i dropped to my knees
i prayed to the being in the sky that my parents told me of
i asked about you but no reply, no clues about your love

and i find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
and i do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
my girlfriend left me on the phone, i'm pathetically left here alone
i cannot call this sane, i cannot call this sane

can we find away
so that you can stay?
i think i'm gonna pop

i find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?

i sit alone in my bedroom
staring at the walls
my pulse is speeding, my breath is short and

i hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
'cause she's 2,000 light years away
she holds my malachite so tight, so never let go
'cause she's 2,000 light years away

i sit outside and watch the sun rise
look out as far as i can
i can't see her, but in the distance
i hear some laughter, we laugh together

i hold my breath and close my eyes and dream about her
'cause she's 2,000 light years away
she holds my malachite so tight, so never let go
'cause she's 2,000 light years away

i sit alone in my bedroom

juliet's trying to find out what she wants, but she don't know
experience has got her down
well, look this direction, i know it's not perfection, it's just me
i want to bring you up again now

'cause i'm losing what's left of my dignity
a small price to pay to see that you're happy
forget all the disappointments you have faced
open up your worried world and let me in

juliet's crying, well, now she's realizing love can be
filled with pain and distrust
i know i am crazy and a bit lazy
but i will try to bring you up again somehow

dear mother, can you hear me whining?
it's been three whole weeks since i have left your home
this sudden fear has left me trembling
'cause now it seems that i am out here on my own and i'm feeling so alone

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

a gunshot rings out at the station
another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
it makes me wonder why i'm still here
for some strange reason, it's now feeling like my own and i'm never gonna go

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
it's been six whole months since i have left your home
it makes me wonder why i'm still here
for some strange reason, it's now feeling like my own and i'm never gonna go

pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
some call it slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland i like to call my home
welcome to paradise, whoa, paradise


staring out of my window, watching the cars go rolling by
my friends are gone, i've got nothing to do
so i sit here patiently, watching the clock tick so slowly
gotta get away or my brains will explode

give me something to do to kill some time
take me to that place that i call home
take away the strains of being lonely
take me to the tracks at christie road

see the hills from afar, standing on my beat-up car
now i feel like me once again as the train comes a-rolling in
smoked my boredom gone, slapped my brains up so high

give me something to do to kill some time
take me to that place that i call home
take away the strains of being lonely
take me to the tracks at christie road

mother, stay out of my way
of that place we go
we'll always seem to find our way
to christie road

mother, stay out of my way
of that place we go
we'll always seem to find our way
to christie road

if there's one thing that i need
that makes me feel complete
so i go to christie road
it's home, it's home


i wander down these streets all by myself
think of my future now, i just don't know
or i don't seem to care

i stop to notice that i'm by your home
i wonder if you're sitting all alone
or is your boyfriend there?

because i feel so right
let my imagination go
until you're in my sights
and through my veins temptation flows

so i sit down here on the hard concrete
think of my future now, i just don't know
or i don't seem to care

i stop to notice that i'm by your home
i wonder if you're sitting all alone
or is your boyfriend there?

because i feel so right
let my imagination go
until you're in my sights
and through my veins temptation flows

because i feel so right
let my imagination go
until you're in my sights
and through my veins temptation flows


i want to be your dominated love slave
i want to be the one that takes the pain
you can spank me when i do not behave
smack me in the forehead with a chain

'cause i love feeling dirty
and i love feeling cheap
and i love it when you hurt me
so drive those staples deep

i want you to slap me and call me naughty
put a belt sander against my skin
want to feel pain all over my body
can't wait to be punished for my sins

i love feeling dirty
and i love feeling cheap
and i love it when you hurt me
so drive those staples deep

i love feeling dirty
and i love feeling cheap
and i love it when you hurt me
so drive... staples?


when i was younger i thought that the world circled around me
but in time, i realized i was so wrong
my immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
it was a tragic case of my reality

do you think you're indestructible
and no one can touch you?
well, i think you're disposable
and it's time you knew the truth

'cause it's just one of my lies
well, it's just one of my lies
and all i want to do is get real high
well, it's just one of my lies

why does my life have to be so small, and death is forever
and does forever have a life to call its own?
don't give me an answer 'cause you only know as much as i know
unless you're been there once, hell, i hardly think so

do you think you're indestructible
and no one can touch you?
well, i think you're disposable
and it's time you knew the truth

'cause it's just one of my lies
well, it's just one of my lies
and all i wanna do is get real high
well, it's just one of my lies

before i lay myself down
my mother said it was right
her mother set it down - why?


my mental stability reaches its bitter end
and all my senses are coming unglued
is there any cure for this disease someone called love?
not as long as there are girls like you

everything she does questions my mental health
it makes me lose control, i want to hurt myself

if anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated

sometimes i wonder if i should be left alone
or lock myself up in a padded room
i'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
'cause no one wants to hear a drunken fool

everything she does questions my mental health
it makes me lose control, i just can't trust myself

if anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated

i do not mind if this goes on
'cause now it seems i'm too far gone
i must admit that i enjoy myself
80, please keep taking me away, away

everything she does questions my mental health
it makes me lose control, i just can't trust myself

if anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated


hey, old man in woman's shoes
i wonder if he knows i think he's crazy
when he was young, did he have dreams of
wearing women's shoes and being crazy?

it makes me wonder when i grow to be that age
will i be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
or will i grow that old, will i still be around?
the way i carry on, i'll end up six feet underground and waste away

when the old man was in school
did the golden rules make him go crazy?
or did he hide away from hopes
behind a smile and smoking dope? it's crazy

it makes me wonder when i grow to be that age
will i be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
or will i grow that old, will i still be around?
the way i carry on, i'll end up six feet underground and waste away

and it seems so frightening, time passes by like lightning
before you know it, you're struck down
i always waste my time on my chemical emotions
it keeps my head spinning around, waste away

and it seems so frightening, time passes by like lightning
before you know it, you're struck down
i always waste my time on my chemical emotions
it keeps my head spinning around, waste away


why should my fun have to end?
for me it's only the beginning
i see my friends begin to age
a short countdown to their end

call me irresponsible, call me habitual
but when you think of me
do you fill your head with schemes?
better think again 'cause no one knows

i don't want to cause no harm
but sometimes my actions hurt
is there something i should find
to make plans for forever?

call me irresponsible, call me habitual
but when you think of me
do you fill your head with schemes?
better think again 'cause no one knows

call me irresponsible, call me habitual
but when you think of me
do you fill your head with schemes?
better think again 'cause no one knows

does it seem like all your memories fade?
you soak up knowledge to fill the space
and still my answer remains
i don't know


a thought burst in my head and i need to tell you
it's news that i forethought
was it just a dream that happened long ago?
i think i just forgot

well, it hasn't been the first time
and it sure does drive me mad

that's when i say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting

i shuffle through my mind to see if i can find
the words i left behind
was it just a dream that happened long ago?
oh well, never mind

well, it hasn't been the first time
and it sure does drive me mad

that's when i say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting

that's when i say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting

there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting


now it seems i can't keep my mind of you
my brain drifts back to better days we've been through
like sitting on blacktops of the school grounds

but now it's gone
and i take the blame
but there's nothing i can do but take the pain
why?

now i dwell on what you remind me of
a sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
as for me, i am blind without a cause
and now i realize what i have lost

it was something real
that i could have had
now i play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
why?

tell me worlds of words i might have said
it's pumping pressure deep inside my head
was it bad enough to be too late?
just tell me the words i might have ate

the words i might have ate
the words i might have ate

but now it's gone
and i take the blame
but there's nothing i can do but take the pain
why?

why?
why?
why?
oh, why?
why?
why?


sweet young girl, so soft and blonde
does exactly what she's been warned
intoxication's in her veins
sweet young boy plays with her brain

believing all his pain filled lies
putting his hands onto her thighs
her purity has now been ripped
he takes it away and then he says

sweet children
sweet children
sweet children
we'll never win

johnny ray's running scared
as the end is drawing near
running from the light of day
?or maybe lie and celebrate?

the slightest urge goes from his hands
follow me if you understand
he's got the trigger on his gun
final sin and now he runs

sweet children
sweet children
sweet children
we'll never win

sweet children
sweet children
sweet children
we'll never win


come with me and let's go for a ride
follow me out to the other side
as i sit around and watch you pout
'cause i know that you're the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around

running wild and always running free
exploring things that i have never seen
hearing colors and all i see are sounds
now i know that you're the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around

i'm seeing faces of mysteries of the earth
i am not one with the aggressions of my birth
or go to stance or hallucinations i can't find
a missing piece of the thought that's in my mind

come with me and let's go for a ride
follow me out to the other side
as i sit around and watch you pout
'cause i know that you're the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around

running wild and always running free
exploring things that i have never seen
hearing colors and all i see are sounds
now i know that you're the

best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around


looking out through clouds in the sky
floating image in my mind
land of beauty and land of grace
now i wonder where this place is from

the average person is everywhere
i got a job and now i'm scared
strange beings all around
come everyone to this place i've found

evidence is everywhere
i start to run, now i'm scared
strange beings all around.
everyone come to this place i've found

i feel what it's like to be wanted
and wonder why
unlocked doors will be open
no more cries

my eyes are clear and now i'm cured
don't you want to be for sure
i know my rights, i'm allowed to die
so i'd rather swap your different guise

it's in my head that you will find
mother love from all mankind
you look above and then you shout
no other way to say your head is right

i feel what it's like to be wanted
and wonder why
unlocked doors will be open
no more cries

i feel what it's like to be wanted
and wonder why
unlocked doors will be open
no more cries


i think i can do who...


my generation







i declare i don't care no more
i'm burning up and out and growing bored
in my smoked out boring room

my hair is shagging in my eyes

i'm not growing up, i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

apathy has rained on me
now i'm feeling like a soggy dream
so close to drowning but i don't mind

i've lived in this mental cave
throw my emotions in the grave
hell, who needs them anyway

i'm not growing up, i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
i'm not growing up, i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

i'm not growing up, i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
i'm not growing up, i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line to walk amongst the dead


i'm taking all you down with me
explosives duct taped to my spine
nothing's gonna change my mind

i won't listen to anyone's last words
there's nothing left for you to say
soon you'll be dead anyway

well, no one here is getting out alive
this time i've really lost my mind and i don't care
so close your eyes
and kiss yourself goodbye
and think about the times you spent and what they've meant

to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing

i'm losing all my happiness
the happiness you pinned on me
loneliness still comforts me
my anger dwells inside of me

well, no one here is getting out alive
this time i've really lost my mind and i don't care
so close your eyes
and kiss yourself goodbye
and think about the times you spent and what they've meant

to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing

do you ever think back to another time?
does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
do you ever build up all the small things in your head
to make one problem that adds up to nothing

to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing


i don't know you, but i think i hate you
you're the reason for my misery
strange how you've become my biggest enemy
and i've never even seen your face

well, maybe it's just jealousy
mixing up with a violent mind
a circumstance that doesn't make much sense
or maybe i'm just dumb

you're the cloud hanging out over my head
hail comes crashing down welting my face
magic man, egocentric plastic man
yet you still got one over on me

maybe it's just jealousy
mixing up with a violent mind
a circumstance that doesn't make much sense
or maybe i'm just dumb

i'm a chump


i sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
i change the channels for an hour or two
twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
in a house with unlocked doors

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
i'm so damn bored, i'm goin' blind

peel me off this velcro seat and get me movin'
i sure as hell can't do it by myself
i'm feelin' like a dog in heat
barred indoors from the summer street
i locked the door to my own cell and i lost the key

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
i'm so damn bored, i'm goin' blind

i got no motivation
where is my motivation?
no time for the motivation
smokin' my inspiration
huah!

i sit around and watch the phone, but no one's callin'
call me pathetic, call me what you will
my mother says to get a job
but she don't like the one she's got
when masturbation's lost its fun
suh!

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
i'm so damn bored, i'm goin' blind
and loneliness has to suffice

bite my lip and close my eyes
i was slippin' away to paradise
a-some say quit or i'll go blind
but it's just a myth

in my lonely feeling
from my darkest dreams,
i go on through days as i wonder,
always changing, forever dreaming
am i the master of my soul?

now my reason's changing.
fear has faded away.
no more days of my wonder,
can't stop feeling,
no disbelieving,
yes, i'm the master of my soul.


mountain of mystery
rising high above the clouds.
mountain of magic
standin' tall and proud
your magical veins flowing silver and gold
your cumulus cloud glows misty red
as apollo sets beyond your head

releasing the pressure built over the years
the mountain is crying hot lava tears
molten rock created under
vibrations of subterranean thunder
ejecting boulders like pieces of sand
the mountain is giving birth to the land
birth to the land

under your feet, you feel a rumble
as thousands of rocks
are starting to tumble
above the trees where the buzzard flies
swirling vapors begin to rise
beneath those misty peaks you hide
a tremendous force boiling deep inside


mama said, she said it's gonna be alright
yes she did, well come to bed and turn out the light

but women trade in black
and now she's sinning on you
giving you my heart, there's nothin' you can do

standing in the shadows in the palace of my dreams

don't be so wise, i was born to fly
not without a place in the wind
walked off a cliff, then i closed my eyes
ooh, i'm not a spaceman, no, no
ooh, i'm not a spaceman

don't need no feathers, i don't need no twine,
i'm all together in my body and my mind,
not supernatural, just a human combine,
ooh, i'm not a spaceman, no, no
ooh, i'm not a spaceman!

can't see a castle, i don't need a sleigh,
i brought my wings, no, not today
i'm a cosmopolitan, right-handed wingless man
ooh, i'm not a spaceman, no, no
ooh, i'm not a spaceman.


who are the ones that slip and slide through life,
moving like the waves in a sink,
people, always need a minute or two to think.

who says they're not going to hell,
climbing the stairway to you know where,
people, oh! so happy until they scare.

who always has got to talk about somebody else,
born as a god, they think that's got to be
people, simply just another you and me.


many days have faded away and the time has passed,
those were memories that have been by so fast,
i can't see you
i can't hear you
but i feel you

i would find you,
i would find you,
well, i would find you,
i would find you

now that we know that we've been there and the time is running out,
that message was from the lord without a doubt,
i can't see you
i can't hear you
but i feel you

could it be that i feel so all alone
it's you that's driving me mad
you won't leave me alone

you have touched my soul
you have touched my soul
now hear me-

could it be that you feel so all alone?
if it's me that's driving you mad,
oh, i would leave you alone
oh yes i would.


when you give your all
and you're feeling small, don't you cry
if you're crying loud,
you won't feel so proud, don't you cry.

there's a place to be
won't you stay with me
you can't help, but see
here we are.

let yourself go by,
you can touch the sky
if you try.

all you've got to show
you may never know, what you are.
if you ever try,
can you tell me why, why you are.

only you will know
and you picked your show.
can you tell me though,
will you know?

if you feel like me
you can't help but please
who you know.
if you're feelin' low,
will you tell me though, who you are.

only you will know
and you picked your show
can you tell me though,
will you know?

if you feel like me
you can't help but please
who you know.


i get beside women all men desire,
crazy with passion i'll never be tired,
money's no good to me 'cause lovin's my game,
i don't need no trouble and i'll show you no pain.
i move like a lover, so silent and swift,
screamin' women love me, just can't resist
i can't be bought, your payoff's no good,
so lock up your women, like you know you should.


sitting in the corner of a room, thinkin' of you.
wonderin' what you're doing now we're apart.
no use cryin', tears can't reach you now.
memories, fulfilling dreams.

you used to be, so good to me,
i can't live without you.
i'd like to be, in your fantasy baby,
part of you is me, wo-

walking across the clouds, hope i see you there.
hope you see me too, before i meet my end.
someone stole my life away, i can't pretend.


oh baby, your face is dark, and your eyes are wild.
oh baby, you look to me as if you're still a child.

your innocence to me is so hard to believe,
just a spell in my past, tell me, how long will you last.

oh baby, you stole my lonely heart for you.
oh baby, i wanna tell you what you can do.

i no longer care about the things we shared, you always had your way.

bass solo, take one


we do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
a feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad

adrenalin starts to flow
you're thrashing all around
acting like a maniac
whiplash!

bang your head against the stage like you never did before
make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
in a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes

adrenalin starts to flow
you're thrashing all around
acting like a maniac
whiplash!

here on the stage the marshalls' noise is piercing through your ears
it kicks your ass, kick your face, exploding feeling nears
we're gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose

adrenalin starts to flow
you're thrashing all around
acting like a maniac

here we go!

whiplash!

the show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
another town, another gig, again we will explode
hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
but we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're metallica

adrenalin starts to flow
you're thrashing all around
acting like a maniac


sound is ripping through your ears
the deafening sound of metal nears
your body's waiting for his whips
the taste of leather on your lips

hear the cry of war, louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

victims falling under chains
you hear them crying death pains
the fists of terrors breaking through
now there's nothing you can do

hear the cry of war, louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

the leather armies have prevailed
the phantom lord has never failed
smoke is lifting from the ground
the rising volume metal sound

hear the cry of war, louder than before
with his sword in hand to control the land
fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lord


no mercy for what we are doing
no thought to even what we have done
we don't need to feel the sorrow
no remorse for the helpless one

war without end

no remorse, no repent
we don't care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath
no remorse, no repent
we don't care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath

blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
we don't need the feel the sorrow
no remorse is the one command

war without end

no remorse, no repent
we don't care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath
no remorse, no repent
we don't care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath

only the strong survive
no one to save the weaker race
we are ready to kill all comers
like a loaded gun right at your face

war without end
no remorse, no repent
we don't care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath
no remorse, no repent
we don't care what it meant
another day, another death
another sorrow, another breath

attack
bullets are flying
people are dying
with madness surrounding
all hell's breaking loose
soldiers are hounding
bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
with war machines going
blood starts a-flowing
no mercy given to anyone here
the furious fighting
swords are like lightning
it all becomes frightening

do unto others as they've done to you
but what the hell is this world coming to?

blow the universe into nothingness
nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

fight fire with fire
ending is near
fight fire with fire
bursting with fear

we all shall die

time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
armageddon's here, like said in the past

fight fire with fire
ending is near

soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
the gods are laughing, so take your last breath

guilty as charged but damn it, it ain't right
there's someone else controlling me
death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
this can't be happening to me

who made you god to say
"i'll take your life from you"?

flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame

wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
it's the beginning of the end
sweat chilling cold as i watch death unfold
consciousness my only friend

my fingers grip with fear
what am i doing here?

flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame

someone help me, oh please god help me
they're trying to take it all away
i don't want to die

someone help me, oh please god help me
they're trying to take it all away
i don't want to die

time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
the final curtain all i see
how true is this? just get it over with
if this is true, just let it be

wakened by horrid scream
freed from this frightening dream

flash before my eyes
now it's time to die
burning in my brain
i can feel the flame


make his fight on the hill in the early day
constant chill deep inside
shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
on they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
for a hill, men would kill, why? they do not know
stiffened wounds test their pride
men of five, still alive through the raging glow
gone insane from the pain that they surely know

for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls

take a look to the sky just before you die
it's the last time he will
blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
he hears the silence so loud
crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

for whom the bell tolls
time marches on
for whom the bell tolls


life it seems will fade away
drifting further every day
getting lost within myself
nothing matters, no one else

i have lost the will to live
simply nothing more to give
there is nothing more for me
need the end to set me free

things not what they used to be
missing one inside of me
deathly loss, this can't be real
cannot stand this hell i feel

emptiness is filling me
to the point of agony
growing darkness taking dawn
i was me but now he's gone

no one but me can save myself but it's too late
now i can't think, think why i should even try

yesterday seems as though it never existed
death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye
goodbye


i don't know how to live through this hell
woken up, i'm still locked in this shell
frozen soul, frozen down to the core
break the ice, i can't take anymore

freezing, can't move at all
screaming, can't hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out, "i'm trapped under ice"

crystallized, as i lay here and rest
eyes of glass stare directly at death
from deep sleep i have broken away
no one knows, no one hears what i say

freezing, can't move at all
screaming, can't hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out, "i'm trapped under ice"

scream from my soul
fate mystified
hell forever more
scream from my soul
fate mystified
hell forever more

no release from my cryonic state
what is this? i've been stricken by fate
wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
hand of doom has a tight grip on me

freezing, can't move at all
screaming, can't hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out, "i'm trapped under ice"
freezing, can't move at all
screaming, can't hear my call
i am dying to live
cry out, "i'm trapped under ice"


feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
i know i'm my best friend
no one cares, but i'm so much stronger
i'll fight until the end

to escape from the true false world
undamaged destiny
can't get caught in the endless circle
ring of stupidity

out for my own, out to be free
one with my mind, they just can't see
no need to hear things that they say
life's for my own to live my own way

don't tell me what to do
i don't care now 'cause i'm on my side
and i can see through you

feed my brain with your so called standards
who says that i ain't right
break away from your common fashion
see through your blurry sight

out for my own, out to be free
one with my mind, they just can't see
no need to hear things that they say
life's for my own to live my own way

see them try to bring the hammer down
no damn chains can hold me to the ground

life's for my own to live my own way
life's for my own to live my own way
life's for my own to live my own way
life's for my own to live my own way

life's for my own to live my own way
life's for my own to live my own way
life's for my own to live my own way


slaves, hebrews born to serve to the pharaoh
heed to his every word, live in fear
faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
wait, something must be done for hundred years

so let it be written
so let it be done
i'm sent here by the chosen one
so let it be written
so let it be done
to kill the first born pharaoh son
i'm creeping death

now, let my people go, land of goshen
go, i will be with thee, bush of fire
blood, running red and strong, down the nile
plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire

so let it be written
so let it be done
i'm sent here by the chosen one
so let it be written
so let it be done
to kill the first born pharaoh son
i'm creeping death

die by my hand
i creep across the land
killing first-born man
die by my hand
i creep across the land
killing first-born man

born, i shall soon be there, deadly mass
i creep the steps and floor, final darkness
blood, lambs blood painted door, i shall pass

so let it be written
so let it be done
i'm sent here by the chosen one
so let it be written
so let it be done
to kill the first born pharaoh son
i'm creeping death


lashing out the action, returning the reaction
weak are ripped and torn away
hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
battery is here to stay

smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery
battery

crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
never ending potency
hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
breeding on insanity

smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery
battery

circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
powerhouse of energy
whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
we create the battery

smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
cannot stop the battery
pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
cannot kill the battery
cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
battery

battery
battery
battery


end of passion play, crumbling away
i'm your source of self-destruction
veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
leading on your death's construction

taste me you will see
more is all you need
dedicated to
how i'm killing you

come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master

master of puppets, i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
blinded by me, you can't see a thing
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
"master, master"
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
"master, master"

needlework the way, never you betray
life of death becoming clearer
pain monopoly, ritual misery
chop your breakfast on a mirror

taste me you will see
more is all you need
dedicated to
how i'm killing you

come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master

master of puppets, i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
blinded by me, you can't see a thing
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
"master, master"
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
"master, master"

master, master
master, master

master, master
where's the dreams that i've been after?
master, master
promised only lies
laughter, laughter
all i hear and see is laughter
laughter, laughter
laughing at my cries
fix me

hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
neverending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season

i will occupy
i will help you die
i will run through you
now i rule you too

come crawling faster
obey your master
your life burns faster
obey your master
master

master of puppets, i'm pulling your strings
twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
blinded by me, you can't see a thing
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
"master, master"
just call my name 'cause i'll hear you scream
"master, master"


messenger of fear in sight
dark deception kills the light

hybrid children watch the sea
pray for father, roaming free

fearless wretch, insanity
he watches, lurking beneath the sea
great old one, forbidden site
he searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

immortal
in madness you dwell

crawling chaos underground
cult has summoned twisted sound

out from ruins once possessed
fallen city, living death

fearless wretch, insanity
he watches, lurking beneath the sea
timeless sleep has been upset
he awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising

immortal
in madness you dwell

in madness you dwell

not dead which eternal lie
stranger eons, death may die

drain you of your sanity
face the thing that should not be

fearless wretch, insanity
he watches, lurking beneath the sea
great old one, forbidden site
he searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

immortal
in madness you dwell


welcome to where time stands still
no one leaves and no one will
moon is full, never seems to change
just labelled mentally deranged
i see our freedom in my sight
no locked doors, no windows barred
no things to make my brain seem scarred

sleep, my friend, and you will see
that dream is my reality
they keep me locked up in this cage
can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"

sanitarium, leave me be
sanitarium, just leave me alone

build my fear of what's out there
cannot breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that i'm insane
they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
keep him tied, it makes him well
he's getting better, can't you tell?

no more can they keep us in
listen, damn it, we will win
they see it right, they see it well
but they think this saves us from our hell

sanitarium, leave me be
sanitarium, just leave me alone
sanitarium, just leave me alone

fear of living on
natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air
got some death to do
mirror stares back hard
kill, it's such a friendly word
seems the only way
for reaching out again


bodies fill the fields i see, hungry heroes end
no one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
victim of what said should be, a servant till i fall

soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
twenty-one, only son but he served us well
bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
finished here, greetings death, he's yours to take away

back to the front, you will do what i say, when i say
back to the front, you will die when i say, you must die
back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
more a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends
bodies fill the fields i see, the slaughter never ends

soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
twenty-one, only son but he served us well
bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
finished here, greetings death, he's yours to take away

back to the front, you will do what i say, when i say
back to the front, you will die when i say, you must die
back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

why am i dying?
kill, have no fear
lie, live off lying
hell, hell is here

why am i dying?
kill, have no fear
lie, live off lying
hell, hell is here
i was born for dying

life planned out before my birth, nothing could i say
had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
looking back i realize, nothing have i done
left to die with only friend, alone i clench my gun

soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
twenty-one, only son but he served us well
bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
finished here, greetings death, he's yours to take away

back to the front, you will do what i say, when i say
back to the front, you will die when i say, you must die
back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man, back to the front

back to the front
back to the front
back to the front
back to the front


one, two
one, two, three, four, five

spineless from the start
sucked into the part
circus comes to town
you play the lead clown

please, please
spreading his disease, living by his story
knees, knees
falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
you will

time for lust, time for lie
time to kiss your life goodbye
send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
bow to leper messiah

marvel at his tricks
need your sunday fix
blind devotion came
rotting your brain

chain, chain
join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
fame, fame
infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
we see

time for lust, time for lie
time to kiss your life goodbye
send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
bow to leper messiah

witchery, weakening
see the sheep are gathering
set the trap, hypnotize
now you follow

time for lust, time for lie
time to kiss your life goodbye
send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

lie, lie, lie, lie
lie, lie, lie, lie


dealing out the agony within
charging hard and no one's going to give in
living on your knees, conformity
or dying on your feet for honesty

inbred, our bodies work as one
bloody, but never cry submission
following our instinct, not a trend
go against the grain until the end

blood will follow blood
dying time is here
damage, incorporated

stepping out? you'll feel our hell on your back
blood follows blood and we make sure
life ain't for you and we're the cure

honesty is my only excuse
try to rob us of it, but it's no use
steamroller action crushing all
victim is your name and you shall fall

blood will follow blood
dying time is here
damage, incorporated

we chew and spit you out
we laugh, you scream and shout
all flee, with fear you run
you'll know just where we come from
damage, incorporated
go

damage jackals ripping right through you
sight and smell of this, it gets me going
know just how to get just what we want

never happy endings on these dark sets
all's fair for damage, inc. you see
step a little closer, if you please

blood will follow blood
dying time is here
damage, incorporated


strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, uncle arthur closes shop
screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
climbs across his bike and he's away
cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street
back to mother, it's another empty day

uncle arthur likes his mommy
uncle arthur still reads comics
uncle arthur follows batman

round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from mum
on his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
sally was the real thing, not just lust

uncle arthur vanished quickly
uncle arthur and his new bride
uncle arthur follows sally

round and round goes arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
little sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
uncle arthur packed his bags and fled
back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
he gets his pocket money, he's well fed

uncle arthur past the gasworks
uncle arthur past the river
uncle arthur down the high street
uncle arthur follows mother


la la la la la la
la la la la la la la

a winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
my summer girl takes little backward steps away
jack frost took her hand and left me
jack frost ain't so cool

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold

and when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
see the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold

see my eyes, my window pane
see my tears like gentle rain
that's the memory of a summer day

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold



rubber band
there's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
in the library garden sunday afternoon
while a little chappie waves a golden wand

rubber band
in 1910, i was so handsome and so strong
my moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
and i loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

dear rubber band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh

rubber band
won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
while i eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
the sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

oh, play that theme

rubber band
how i wish that i could join your rubber band
we could play in library parks throughout the land
and one sunday afternoon, i'd find my love

rubber band
in the '14-'18 war i went to sea
thought my sunday love was waiting home for me
and now she's married to the leader of the band, oh

oh sob, i hope you break your baton


just look through your window, look who sits outside
when you walk out through your door, i'll wave my flag and shout

oh, beautiful baby
my burning desire started on sunday
give me your heart and i'll love you till tuesday

who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
if you lie beneath my shade, i'll keep you nice and cool

my passion's never-ending and i'll love you till tuesday

there is a happy land where only children live
they don't have the time to learn the ways
of you sir, mr. grownup

there's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
it's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, mr. grownup
go away, sir

charlie brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite
jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and tommy's learned to ride his bike
tiny tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
he gets in the way but we always let him play with us

mother calls, but we don't hear
there's lots more things to do
it's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
but we will be, very shortly

sissy steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away
tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and ray

there is a happy land where only children live
you've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, mr. grownup
go away, sir

according to the latest world population survey,
figures have reached danger point, my god!

my studies include exophagy.
i formed my own society,
to crush the power of fecundity.
the world will overpopulate,
unless you claim infertility.
so who will buy a drink for me, your messiah?

we are not your friends.
we don't give a damn for what you're saying.
we're here to live our lives.

i propose to give the pill
free of charge to those that feel
that they are not infertible.
the crops of few, the cattle gun.
there's only one way to linger on.
so who will buy a drink for me, your messiah?

we are not your friends.
we don't give a damn for what you're saying.
we're here to live our lives.

anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air
will be slaughtered and cremated.
only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
i've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
we will turn a blind eye to infanticide.

we are not your friends.
we don't give a damn for what you're saying.
we're here to live our lives.

you don't seem to hear me clear.
do i talk above your sphere?
let me explain my project, dear,
show you how i'll save the world,
or let it die within the year.
why do you look that way at me, your messiah?

we are not your friends.
we don't give a damn for what you're saying.
we're here to live our lives.

we are hungry men.
we don't give a damn for what you're saying.
we're here to eat you.


when i live my dream, i'll take you with me
riding on a golden horse
we'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
happy at the sound of your voice

maybe i'll slay a dragon for you
or banish wicked giants from the land
but you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you
we will only love each other as forever
when i live my dream

when i live my dream, i'll forgive the things you've told me
and the empty man you left behind
it's a broken heart that dreams
it's a broken heart you left me
only love can live in my dream

i'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
wish, and the storm will fade away
wish again, and you will stand before me
while the sky will paint an overture
and trees will play the rhythm of my dream

when i live my dream, please be there to meet me
let me be the one to understand
when i live my dream, i'll forget the hurt you gave me
then we can live in our new land

till the day my dream cascades around me
i'm content to let you pass me by
till that day, you'll run to many other men
but let them know it's just for now
tell them that i've got a dream
and tell them you're the starring role
tell them i'm a dreaming kind of guy
and i'm gonna make my dream
tell them i will live my dream
tell them they can laugh at me
but don't forget your date with me
when i live my dream...


war made him a soldier
little frankie mear
peace left him a loser
the little bombardier

lines of worry appeared with age
unskilled hands that knew no trade
spent his time in the picture house
the little bombardier

frankie drank his money
the little that he made
told his woes to no man
friendless, lonely days

then one day, in the abc
four bright eyes gazed longingly
at the ice-cream in the hand of
the little bombardier

sunshine entered our frankie's days
gone his worries, his hopeless maze
his life was fun and his heart was full of joy

two young children had changed his aims
he gave them toffees and played their games
he brought them presents with every coin he made

then two gentlemen called on him
asked him for his name
why was he friends with the children
were they just a game?

leave them alone or we'll get sore
we've had blokes like you in the station before
the hand of authority said "no more" to
the little bombardier

packed his bags, his heart in pain
wiped a tear and caught a train
not to be seen in the town again
the little bombardier


mountains of lhasa are feeling the rain
people are walking the potala lanes
preacher takes the school
one boy breaks a rule

silly boy blue, blue
silly boy blue

yak butter statues that melt in the sun
cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
a chela likes to feel

you've tried so hard to fly
you'll never leave your body now
you've got to wait to die

smiling girls and rosy boys
come and buy my little toys
monkeys made of gingerbread
and sugar horses painted red

rich men's children running past
their fathers dressed in hose
golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
gazing eyes and running wild
past the stocks and over stiles
kiss the window merry child
but come and buy my toys

you've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill
the miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
leave the parsley on the stalls
come and buy my toys

you shall work your father's land
but now you shall play in the market square
till you'll be a man

smiling girls and rosy boys

let me introduce you to the gang
johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
once he had a name, now he plays our game
you won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang

molly is the model in the ads
crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang

arthur is a singer with a band
arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
look at arthur rave, all the kids are paid
they want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

you won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
it's a big illusion but at least you're in
at least you're in

this club's called the webb, it's this month's pick
next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
this is how to spend now that you've joined the gang

this is what to do now that you're here
sit round doing nothing all together very fast
psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
they're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang


she'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
she played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
and never took her out.
she wore a trench coat, khaki.
her hobnail boots were full of holes.
she's got medals.

her mother called her "mary," but she changed her name to "tommy,"
she's a one... oh.
she went and joined the army,
passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
they sent her to the front line,
fighting for her country's name.
she's got medals.

she got very tired of picking up girls,
cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
then the enemy dropped a bomb.
survivors there were none.

people say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
you can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
she'd deserted on the previous morning.
replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
called herself eileen.
came to london town.
now she's settled down.
she's got medals.


this girl is made of lipstick
powder and paint
sees the pictures of herself
every magazine on every shelf

this girl is maid of bond street
hailing cabs, lunches with executives
gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

this girl is a lonely girl
takes the train from paddington to oxford circus
buys the daily news
but passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her

this girl is made of loneliness
a broken heart
for the boy that she once knew
doesn't want to know her any more

and this girl is a lonely girl
every thing she wants is hers
but she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
all the time, to love, all the time

this boy is made of envy
jealousy
he doesn't have a limousine
really wants to be a star himself

this girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

and maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
maids of bond street picture clothes, eyes of stars
maids of bond street shouldn't have worldly cares
maids of bond street shouldn't have love affairs


there's a little churchyard just along the way
it used to be lambeth's finest array
of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

and in this little yard, there's a little old man
with a little shovel in his little bitty hand
he seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
he hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home

"ah-choo, excuse me"

please mr. gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
as you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
please mr. gravedigger, i couldn't care
if you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
and you put it in your pocket

"god, it's pouring down"

her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
she thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
and ma wouldn't understand, so i won't tell
so keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

yes, mr. gd, you see me every day
standing in the same spot by a certain grave
mary-ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
and i was the wicked man who took her life away
very selfish, oh god

no, mr. gd, you won't tell
and just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
i've started digging holes my friend
and this one here's for you

"lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"


strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, uncle arthur closes shop
screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
climbs across his bike and he's away
cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street
back to mother, it's another empty day

uncle arthur likes his mommy
uncle arthur still reads comics
uncle arthur follows batman

round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from mum
on his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
sally was the real thing, not just lust

uncle arthur vanished quickly
uncle arthur and his new bride
uncle arthur follows sally

round and round goes arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
little sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
uncle arthur packed his bags and fled
back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
he gets his pocket money, he's well fed

uncle arthur past the gasworks
uncle arthur past the river
uncle arthur down the high street
uncle arthur follows mother


la la la la la la
la la la la la la la

a winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
my summer girl takes little backward steps away
jack frost took her hand and left me
jack frost ain't so cool

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold

and when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
see the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold

see my eyes, my window pane
see my tears like gentle rain
that's the memory of a summer day

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold

sell me a coat with buttons of silver
sell me a coat that's red or gold
sell me a coat with little patch pockets
sell me a coat 'cause i feel cold

mary-ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
and i was the wicked man who took her life away
very selfish, oh god

no, mr. gd, you won't tell
and just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
i've started digging holes my friend
and this one here's for you

"lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"


in the corner of the morning in the past
i would sit and blame the master first and last
all the roads were straight and narrow
and the prayers were small and yellow
and the rumour spread that i was aging fast
then i ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
and i looked and frowned and the monster was me

well, i said hello and i said hello
and i asked "why not?" and i replied "i don't know."
so we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
and he laughed insane and quipped "kahlil gibran"
so i cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
for i realized that god's a young man too

so i said "so long" and i waved "bye-bye"
and i smashed my soul and traded my mind
got laid by a young bordello
who was vaguely half asleep
for which my reputation swept back home in drag
and the moral of this magic spell
negotiates my hide
when god did take my logic for a ride

he swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
and showed me the leather belt round his hips
my knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
he said "you'll never go down to the gods again"

he struck the ground a cavern appeared
and i smelt the burning pit of fear
we crashed a thousand yards below
i said "do it again, do it again"

his nebulous body swayed above
his tongue swollen with devil's love
the snake and i, a venom high
i said "do it again, do it again"

breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
and i was seething, breathing deeply
spitting sentry, horned and tailed
waiting for you

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


day after day
they send my friends away
to mansions cold and grey
to the far side of town
where the thin men stalk the streets
while the sane stay underground

day after day
they tell me i can go
they tell me i can blow
to the far side of town
where it's pointless to be high
'cause it's such a long way down
so i tell them that

i can fly, i will scream
i will break my arm
i will do me harm
here i stand
foot in hand
talking to my wall
i'm not quite right at all
am i?

don't set me free
i'm as heavy as can be
just my librium and me
and my e.s.t. makes three

'cause i'd rather stay here
with all the madmen
than perish with the sad men roaming free
and i'd rather play here
with all the madmen
for i'm quite content they're all as sane as me

when a nation hides
its organic minds
in a cellar
dark and grim
they must be very dim)

day after day
they take some brain away
then turn my face around
to the far side of town
and tell me that it's real
then ask me how i feel

here i stand
foot in hand
talking to my wall
i'm not quite right at all

don't set me free
i'm as helpless as can be
my libido's split on me
gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

'cause i'd rather stay here
with all the madmen
than perish with the sad men
roaming free
and i'd rather play here
with all the madmen
for i'm quite content
they're all as sane as me

and soon they'll have to go.

as the winners toll the bell.

i'll never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart
all because we all live in the valley of the walls
when they speak, we can peek from the windows of their mouths
to see the land, the women chant as they fly up to the sun

you never think you know why, know
you never think you know why, know
ever think you know why, know

books all say different things, while people flap their yellow wings
trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything
the sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead

you never think you know why, know
you never think you know why, know
ever think you know why, know

on the other side, on the other side, the other side,
do you ever try to fly, do you ever try to fly?
have you ever wanted to die, have you ever wanted to die?

don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly,
don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side,
never try to die, you ever try to die.

you never think you know why, know
you never think you know why, know
you never think you know why, know

people are always chasing me down
trying to push my face to the ground
where all they really want to do

sugar!

the kombucha mushroom people
sitting around all day
who could believe you?

i'm gone away forever
but i'm feeling better!

watching from a post up high
from where you see the ships afar
from a well-trained eye
the waves all keep on crashing by
if you are the light post
then you own the working class
but if you want the answers
you better give a piece of ass
give a piece of your ass

warning, post hypnotic suggestions
running the ships ashore
the orange light that follows
will soon proclaim itself a god
if you point your questions
the fog will surely chew you up
but if you want the answers
you better get ready for the fire
get ready for the fire

the ships are multiplying day after day, sir
and they're coming close to the shore, sir, shore, sir
we need to evacuate the light post
it's all over, it's all over
it's all over




through my head

before you know, awake

your lives are open wide

dreams are made, winding
through my head
through my head

before you know, awake

through my head
through my head
before you know

before you know i will be waiting, all awake

dreams are made winding through her hair

making a decision of death
while everyone around you plead
now you fly in peace
i hope, my friend
a man can't avoid what he's meant to do
when he's meant to do it
even if he doesn't really want to

of weakness within the strength of youth

one was written on the sword
for you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it!

history teaches us so
the reason he must attain
must be approved by his god

that never stopped you from sleeping with this loaded gun

and now you're telling me
that i am the one that won't amount to no good
i'd never die for you, not even if i could
and i am the one that's always misunderstood
i'd never die for you, even if i could
die for you, you know i never would

mommy's little monster
wrapped inside a box
can't forgive her
she threw away the f'kng key
i'll haunt her
you're always telling me
that i am the one that won't amount to no good
i'd never die for you, not even if i could
and i am the one the one that's always misunderstood
i'd never die for you, even if i could
die for you, you know i never would

i fell asleep to the sound
of the church bells ringing out
in this quiet little town i am dreaming
i woke up to the sound
of an angel crying out
gotta leave this little town
gotta move on

not coming home
not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
not coming home
not coming home
i am out here on the road

got a phone call from my son
he said dad your number one
and mommy's going nuts i think she's crazy
put your mother on the phone
i gotta tell her she's not alone
she's sick of waiting around
then i tell her these words

not coming home
not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
not coming home
not coming home
i am out here on the road

keep holding on
it wont be long
but for now

not coming home
not coming home
this christmas i am all alone
not coming home
not coming home
i am out here on the road

keep holding on
it wont be long
but for now

not coming home


remember the girl

she finally left him, had enough of her man's rage
band-aids cover her scars, she left him blooded
beat his ass with a bat, face sunk in like silly putty
y'all can sit back so i can study
destruction of the family design
and how the morals of society decline

it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without

you see she can't live with him and can't live without him
stress got her down, she needs to deal with her problems
as the drama gets deeper, i put on the reefer
took the last step and sent his ass to the reefer
chaos, is what she saw in the mirror
scared of herself and the power that was in her
it took over and weighed heavily on her shoulder
militant insanity is now what controlled her

it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without
it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without


kill it!
before it reaches you
missiles won't work it's approaching the mainland
what if it reaches the metropolitan areas, cosmopolitan areas
secure the lines and prepare for departure, calm, calm, calm
it is a big business and seems to be advanicng underground
cause my style is underground
i'm green with my red eyes mad tint
flee, fly, flow, rapido rapido
she feeds plentiful

don't you see that we are in danger
how will we stop it


running out we're running out

it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without.


i want to let you in on a story
that i got to tell
about good dreams in heaven not
bad dreams in hell
started with punk rock
and then evolved to hip hop
the party popped off
like the fireworks on my block
alonzo is the street that i take dweel
a little white trash
and a little bit swell
i take you back
and take a step down
july was the month
i was born 8 pounds
my bad side
my sign is leo defraud the hoax with a ruby
king of the jungle yet i try to be humble
but i should to let y'all know what i'm' about
attack your brain fast drop knowledge
the i'm out i'm a freak but i got some class
and you can bring the grass
have a session
good times is the lesson
the men will cease fire and
the girls could stop stressin
come on baby doll please jerk me off
perverted state of mind
baby help me get my nut off
what's wrong girly
don't know the art of a quicky
my balls hang low
and they produce something icky
from my dick to your skin
hands rub it in
i know you love lotion baby
that's how i begin
sexual feeding in my dreams
she was screaming down on her knees
as she eating on my seamen
i've this problem
i don't wanna say
but to tell you the truth everybody
i be doing it every day
you may think i'm stupid
you may think i'm queer
but to tell you the truth everybody
jackin off is better than beer!
my bad side


as i look at the picture
of jacoby smoking broccoli
props to refer
props to bible prophecies
it's clearly
evident relationship is permanent
so my mind can be the evidence
i've made my choice
there's no looking back
life long commitment to my second half
hard times, good times
two ways to go
i've got my problems
god only knows
it came faster than a blink of an eye
fire, rain, indapendce, 4th of july
give in, give into tradition
one thing i'd like to say is
my independence day
is wiped from my face
maybe i gave it away
maybe i've got a secret hiding place
i love you
i married you


i could hear myself clear
from the living room
ruptured pain to fear
family's dyin' soon
look in my eye what do you see
lover y amigo tambien enemy
because the best thing is life
is for me to sing these words
all i leave at the shows
are chrome microphone turds
i take fat hits
i cap on the girls
who give out 10$ thigh splits
yo all i want is respect
in this game
cause the papa roach style is wild
and not plain
know what i'm saying
put us through your speakers
'cause i know that we are banging
positivity and negativity
we saying that you
can't get the ying
without the yang
confidence and style
mix it up with some slang
and make it grimy
step up was up
i came to make friends to the end
and back again
and show your stacks again
because sometimes i'm x-rated
sometimes i'm g-rated
sometimes i bugded crowds
act wild
and get faded
whether its monday
or tuesday
or thursday
or friday
i'm getting down
everyday
because it's my way
to express the onion hardcore slang
a boogedy bang bang
boogedy bang bang
sha bang you know what i'm saying
put us through your speakers
'cause i know we are banging
look in my eyes
what do you see
lover y amigo
tambien enemy
the good and the bad
le bein a le mal
chaos forever
natural law


i am a mess
i made a huge mess
i can't control myself!

i kill the rhyme again
i'm comin' sick and on time again
words manifest from deep inside where people hide within'
it's chemical
unbalanced on the triple beam. what?
it's about what i seen
i seen it happen
back hand brand to face smackin'
definite disorder now his mindset is blackened
the doctors say he got the brain of a murderer
this rugged style steals your brain

my heart is bleeding
and this pain it will not pass
it's not receding
and my body's going numb
a bad trip child
rolling stoned keeping high
he don't know what he's doing
he just keeps getting by
thrown away
i want to be thrown away

he's born sick
nothing in his hands but his dick
he couldn't handle pressure
for the life he was leading led him down the wrong path
where guns blast
don't want to talk to the counselor doctor
to tell him what's real
to tell him what's proper
situation's unclear like gray
and i know it gets worse everyday

my heart is bleeding
and this pain will not pass
it's not receding
and my body's going numb
a bad trip child
rolling stoned keeping high
he don't know what he's doing
he just keep getting by away
thrown away
i want to be thrown away

i am a mess
i've made a huge mess
i can't control myself!
i'm losing it
i've lost it
i've spilt all my marbles!

'cause i see you inside of me
sometimes i want to be thrown away

'cause i see you inside of me
sometimes i want to be thrown away

a hyper spaz and that is me
sometimes i want to be thrown away

thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away
thrown away

cut my life into pieces
this is my last resort, suffocation, no breathing
this is my last resort

cut my life into pieces
i've reached my last resort, suffocation, no breathing
do you even care if i die bleeding?
would it be wrong, would it be right?
mutilation out of sight
and i'm contemplating suicide

'cause i'm losing my sight, losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine
losing my sight, losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine

i never realized i was spread too thin
till it was too late and i was empty within
hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin
downward spiral, where do i begin?
it all started when i lost my mother
no love for myself and no love from another
searching to find a lover on a higher level
finding nothing but questions and devils

'cause i'm losing my sight, losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine
losing my sight, losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine
nothing's alright, nothing is fine
i'm running and i'm cryin'

i'm cryin', i'm cryin'
i'm cryin', i'm cryin'

i can't go on living this way

cut my life into pieces
this is my last resort, suffocation, no breathing
would it be wrong, would it be right?
mutilation out of sight
and i'm contemplating suicide

'cause i'm losing my sight, losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine
losing my sight, losing my mind
wish somebody would tell me i'm fine
nothing's alright, nothing is fine
i'm running and i'm cryin'

i can't go on living this way

can't go on living this way
nothing's alright


broken home
all alone
broken home
all alone

i can't seem to fight these feelings
i'm caught in the middle of this
and my wounds are not healing
i'm stuck in between my parents
i wish i had someone to talk to
someone i could confide in
i just want to know the truth
i just want to know the truth
want to know the truth

broken home
all alone

i know my mother loves me
but does my father even care?
if i'm sad or angry
you were never ever there
when i needed you
i hope you regret what you did
i think i know the truth
your father did the same to you
did the same to you

what is wrong with me?
i cannot fight now
i feel like a weak link

what is wrong with me?
i cannot fight now
i feel like a weak link
a weak link

broken home
all alone

it feels bad to be alone
crying by yourself, living in a broken home
how could i tell it so all you could feel it
depression strikes hard just like my old earth would tell it

to me, her son, she told me i'm the one
pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
stories that i tell are nonfiction
and you can't take it back 'cause it's already done

broken home
broken home

can't seem to fight these feelings
caught in the middle of this
my wounds are not healing
stuck in between my parents

broken home
broken home


born with no soul, lack of control
cut from the mold of the anti-social
plug 'em in and then turn 'em on
process the data, make yourself the bomb
what is your target? what is your reason?
do you have emotions? is your heart freezing?
seizin', this opportunity to speak

dead cell! dead cell!

sick in the head, living but dead
hear what i said
learn a lesson from the almighty dread
jah, nutty warrior, nothin's scarier
kids are gettin' sick like malaria
situation gets hairier
i'm throwing up all types of barriers
i'm tellin' you
the kids are getting singled out
let me hear the dead cell shout

dead cell! dead cell!

stop pointing fingers 'cause we all are guilty
of clean cut lies and the truth that's filthy

i don't believe what my eyes behold, no!
i don't believe what my ears are told, no!

there's no money, there's no possessions
take my money, take my obsession

i just wanna be heard, loud and clear are my words
comin' from within', man, tell 'em what you heard
it's about a revolution, in your heart and in your mind
you can't find the conclusion

lifestyle and obsession
diamond rings get you nothin' but a lifelong lesson
and you're pocket book stressin'
you're a slave to the system, workin' jobs that you hate
it's too bad the world is based on greed

step back and see
stop thinkin' 'bout yourself, start thinkin' 'bout

there's no money, there's no possession
take my money, take my possession
take my obsession, i don't need that

'cause everything is nothing and emptiness is in everything
with the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
flip it inside out, it's a big black hole
take your money, burn it up like an asteroid
possessions, they are never gonna fill the void
take it away and learn the best lesson
the heart, the soul, the life, the passion

there's no money, there's no possession
take my money, take my possession

money, possession, obsession

present yourself, press your clothes
comb your hair and clock in
you just can't win, just can't win
and the things you own, own you now

take my money, take my possession

money, possession, obsession


watch your back because the next man is comin'
and you don't know if the next man is dumbin'
survival of the fittest what it is
i got your back, you got my back and that's the biz
blood is rushing through my veins, i got the power
channel the energy and with my strength i will devour
sickenin' thought is running through my head
that's when i realize i'm glad i'm not dead

corruption and abuse
the salesman of our blood
for the public's craving
existence in the dark

it's in our nature to destroy ourselves
it's in our nature to kill ourselves
it's in our nature to kill each other
it's in our nature to kill! kill! kill!

it was a dream and then it hit me, reality struck
and now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
close to buck 50 and we all stand strong
in respect to the family in times of our insanity
and through words of profanity
i describe our dysfunctional family
blood brothers keep it real to the end
deeper than thoughts that you think not a trend

corruption and abuse
the salesman of our blood
for the public's craving
existence in the dark

it's in our nature to destroy ourselves
it's in our nature to kill ourselves
it's in our nature to kill each other
it's in our nature to kill! kill! kill!
it's in our nature to destroy ourselves
it's in our nature to kill ourselves
it's in our nature to kill each other
it's in our nature to kill! kill! kill!
again and again

corruption and abuse
the salesman of our blood
for the public's craving
existence in the dark

it's in our nature to destroy ourselves
it's in our nature to kill ourselves
it's in our nature to kill each other
it's in our nature to kill! kill! kill!
it's in our nature to destroy ourselves
it's in our nature to kill ourselves
it's in our nature to kill each other
it's in our nature to kill! kill! kill! kill! kill!
kill! kill! kill! kill! kill!
kill! kill! kill! kill! kill!
kill! kill! kill! kill! kill!
kill! kill! kill!

it's in our nature to destroy ourselves
it's in our nature to kill ourselves
it's in our nature to kill each other

remember the girl

she finally left him, had enough of her man's rage
band-aids cover her scars, she left him blooded
beat his ass with a bat, face sunk in like silly putty
y'all can sit back so i can study
destruction of the family design
and how the morals of society decline

it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without

you see she can't live with him and can't live without him
stress got her down, she needs to deal with her problems
as the drama gets deeper, i put on the reefer
took the last step and sent his ass to the reefer
chaos, is what she saw in the mirror
scared of herself and the power that was in her
it took over and weighed heavily on her shoulder
militant insanity is now what controlled her

it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without
it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without


kill it!
before it reaches you
missiles won't work it's approaching the mainland
what if it reaches the metropolitan areas, cosmopolitan areas
secure the lines and prepare for departure, calm, calm, calm
it is a big business and seems to be advanicng underground
cause my style is underground
i'm green with my red eyes mad tint
flee, fly, flow, rapido rapido
she feeds plentiful

don't you see that we are in danger
how will we stop it


running out we're running out

it's alright we're in love
can't live with or without.


i got a problem with the snakes that got crawlin'
through my area when the darkness has fallen
and mama told me that they love to bite
bite you in the back no shame that's right, what, what
i keep my distance 'cause they're makin' me crazy
my blood boils, fat turns to oil
over trauma, or you could sleep with the fishes
my clutches are tight and i'll take your last wishes
1 for your money
2 for your girl
3 for your life

do you like how it feels
to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills?
do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
i don't like how it feels check it
do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
break it down

yo, it's kinda funny how you're runnin' your mouth man
you're caught in a lie and then there's no way out, come on
betray your friends and your peeps and your family
livin' like a snake livin' like a bloody thief
check my speech, 'cause it's deep like the sea
from me to y'all, and then from y'all back to me, ha!
danger danger, i slay snakes like a ranger
military style fears god not a stranger
now tell me, tell me who's crew's sicker?
mine's sicker, get on your knees to be a dick licker

1 for your money
2 for your girl
3 for your life

do you like how it feels
to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills?
do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?

do you like how it feels
to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills?
do you know how it feels to be stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill?
do you like how it feels?

i don't like how it feels to be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
by the snake that kills
by the snake that kills.


life's been sucked out of me, this routine's killing me.
i did it to myself, again i said this would not be.
somebody put me out of my misery.
expression, stimulation, hallow sense of myself.
i did it to myself again. somebody put me in my place...

never enough. never enough.

now everything's okay, there's nothing wrong with me.
this seems unnatural, to me i'd say it every way.
somebody kick me in my face.

i'm bleeding profusely and this seems natural.

never enough. never enough.
do i deserve what i got?

pentex sucks!

bonegnawers suck, bonegnawers suck!

the black hand sucks, the black hand sucks!
those wyrm tainted bastard leeches, black hand sucks!

if i had my way! if i had my way!

you can't see me, for i hide within the umbra
you can't see me, for i hide within the umbra
you can't see me, for i hide within the umbra


gently, my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure...
a pleasure that will take my mind off the realities of my life...
my past life...
life as i know it now!

and whatever may come, it slowly disappears!
to somewhere in the back of my mind...
and it will remain there... till i wish to retrieve it!

yes, i will stay here for awhile, for i need the break!
a break from the pressures of life!
and everything that lay in the palm of life's hands!
life's hands!

this mode is incredible! it's out of this world!
too bad i must always leave it...

that's life that's life...
that's life that's life...
that's life that's life...
that's life that's life...

the guilty of crimes will be hung from the trees!
spit and punches arise from you and from me!


pain, made to order!
pain, made to order!
pain, made to order!
pain!

slipping, slapping, scatting on my back, trying to relax
thinking about the facts of the crack running through the pack
division in thought about the war to be fought
for trying to mend the ranks, still i get no thanks
they say they mean no disrespect, but this is in effect
i take to heart the part i play everyday
uninformed is one thing, stupid is another
keep running your mouth, but don't call me brother!

i'm trying to find someone on my side 'cause banging heads all the time starts to grind at my gears and at my will
but persistent i am still

blow to the head, then an entrail rend
guts on the floor, do you want more?
show you the strength of the tenth rank
pain is the only way to teach kids these days!

opened your eyes. you've realized.
talk back to me. your punk-ass dies!

only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!

i'm all you know! where will you go?
valhalla's gone, with your soul!

only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!



kill me!

tattered and torn!
that's where my soul is worn...
tattered and torn!
that's when i was born...
tattered and torn!
i broke away from me
tattered and torn!
i knocked me to my knees!

tattered and torn!
i drink my own cells...
tattered and torn!
a decomposing well...
tattered and torn!
roaches in my head...
tattered and torn!
i become the living dead!

tattered and torn!
torn!
tattered and torn!
torn!
tattered and torn!

tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt
tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt
tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt
tearing myself apart from the things that made me hurt

tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!
tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!
tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!
tearing myself from the things that made me hurt!


i know you don't want to see...
i know you're not part of me...
but you wonder just the same...
so i'll let you in on this game

what's on top is just the beginning of the protectorate that keeps gaia spinning.
it never ends, with the gifts luna sends to the apocalypse
on we defend for the right to live in a perfect world
for our past mistakes, extinction we are hurled
trying to make amends for the impergium

you don't want to know
all of the power of the wyld that runs through me, yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
you don't want to see
our viewpoint on what hobbits are doing, the black inside when frenzy is brewing
you don't want to feel
the sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going
i won't let you be

i'm trying to set my mind free, i'm sorry you never knew me
my soul is in recession, painful to make this confession.

you don't want to know
all of the power of the wyld that runs through me, yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
you don't want to see
our viewpoint on what hobbits are doing, the black inside when frenzy is brewing
you don't want to feel
the sorrow that my heart holds in knowing just where my hopes and dreams are going
i won't let you be

love!


some feel i don't exist, never believing what they see!
some feel that i'm not fair, i leave no time for repentance!

tearing the vail, mending the vail
tearing the vail...
tearing the vail, mending the vail
tearing the vail!

some feel i bare the mark of man!
a misguided philosophy!
some feel i kill for fun!
i kill for life...

i can't escape what gaia's left for me!
i can't deny a lack of morality!

need time to think, need time to think
need to spill blood so i can drink
take what they give take what they give
some feel i'm dead yet still i live

need time to think, need time to think!
need to spill blood so i can drink!
take what they give take what they give!
some feel i'm dead yet still i live!

no!

they don't know i'm eternal!
they don't know they're just cattle!
they don't know i'm eternal!
eternal!


cycle of life and death supposedly
goes round and round yet it stops with me

glorious hunter of my faith i have sinned
killers are quiet like the breath of the wind

filling the shadows with forms of my own
raised by kindred of get i was born

abomination world in disarray
killers are quiet when they seek the vitae

reflection beckons a portal shard
spiritual quest i must stay on guard

stepping sideways betweens worlds i shift
killers are quiet when they are born with the gift

beautiful anguish cast out by my race
now one that's ageless i save my own face

i write my own laws with death i break bread
killers are quiet when they come from my head.

pain

"here comes the pain"

enemy, show me what you wanna be
i can handle anything, even if i can't handle you
readily, either way, it better be

what the hell am i saying?
i don't know about malevolent
sure as hell decadent
i want somebody to step up, step off
get a grip, don't let me slip till i drop the ball

you're going down, this is a war

you're leaving me suspect? i'm leaving you grotesque
feels like a burn from which you never learn
cause and effect, you jealous ass
press your face against the glass, suffer

you're going down, this is a war

you can't kill me, 'cause i'm already inside you
sick

yeah


yeah

i'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain
how many times have you wanted to kill
everything and everyone, say you'll do it, but never will

you can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
you can't see california without marlon brando's eyes

i am my father's son, 'cause he's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing
how many times have you wanted to die?
it's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me

you can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
you can't see california without marlon brando's eyes

it's all in your head
it's all in my head
it's all in your head
yeah

i tried, you lied to me for so long
everywhere i go, there's a sense of it
freak on my antics and give me a choice

you can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
can't see california without marlon brando's eyes
you can't see california without marlon brando's eyes

it's all in your head
it's all in my head
it's all in your head
yeah

do you wanna feel pain? taking my name in vain
caring never felt so lame inside
anybody else got pride? do you wanna take my life?
maybe i'll reverse my ride
better suck it up 'cause you bled through
better get away from me

i feel safe
seems you're saved
seems you're saved

look me in my brand new eye
look me in my brand new eye
look me in my brand new eye

look me in my brand new eye
look me in my brand new eye
look me in my brand new eye
look me in my brand new


i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

good bye
i wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
everything is 3-d blasphemy
my eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
this is not the way i pictured me
i can't control my shakes, how the hell did i get here?
something about this, so very wrong
i have to laugh out loud, i wish i didn't like this
is it a dream or a memory?

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

get outta my head, 'cause i don't need this
why didn't i see this?
but i'm a victim, manchurian candidate
i have sinned by just making my mind up and taking your breath away

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
good bye

you haven't learned a thing, i haven't changed a thing
my flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free
you haven't learned a thing, i haven't changed a thing
my flesh was in my bones, the pain was always free

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

and it waits for you



running out of ways to run
i can't see, i can't be
over and over and under my skin
all this attention is doing me in

don't belong, don't exist

picking through the parts exposed
taking shape, taking shag
over and over and under my skin
all this momentum is doing me in

don't belong, don't exist

burn

you got all my love living in your own hate
dripping hole, man, hard step, no fate
show you nothing, but i ain't holding back
every damn word i say is a sneak attack
when i get my hands on you
get this, 'cause you're never gonna get me
i am the very disease you pretend to be

i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move

don't belong, don't exist
don't belong, don't exist

"no"
burn


did you never give a damn in the first place?
maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'cause in the interest of all involved
i got the problem solved and the verdict is guilty

man, nearly killed me, stepping where you fear to tread
stop, drop, and roll, you were dead from the get-go
are you scared of me now? then you're dumber than i thought

always is and never was
foundation made of piss and vinegar
just another dumb punk chomping at this tit
is there any way to break through the noise?
was it something that i said that got you bent?
gotta be that way if you want it
sanity, literal profanity, hit me

spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out

maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lotta rumor fodder
keeping all your little spies and leaving when you realize
step up, fairy, i guess it's time to bury your ass with a chrome straight to the dome
and if you know what's good, just shut up and beg, brother
backstab, don't you know who you're dissing?
sideswipe, we know the ass that you're kissing!

come up and you get a face full o' tactic
lipping off hard? going home in a basket
you got no pull, no power, no nothing
payoffs don't protect and you can hide if you want
but i'll find you, coming up behind you

spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out

'bout time i set this record straight
all the needle-nose punching is making me irate
where you gonna be in the next five years?
the crew and all the fools and all the politics
get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
you got dick when they passed out the good stuff
bam, are you sick of me? good enough, had enough


spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is slice you up

spit

spit
spit it out

something aches
tattered and torn
bad things slither

my floors are burning down
tattered and torn
and i can't find a window

tattered and torn
this is medieval
tattered and torn
this is cerebral
tattered and torn
suffocated
tattered and torn
melodramatic

tattered and torn
driven to the verge of

i make you my enemy

the nerves you sever
tattered and torn
can serve you better

tattered and torn
in the blink of an eye
tattered and torn
in the space of a second
tattered and torn
open my wrists
tattered and torn
give me my lessons




maze, psychopathic daze, i create this waste
back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways
can't escape this place, i deny your face
sweat gets in my eyes, i think i'm slowly dying

put me in a homemade cellar, put me in a hole for shelter
someone hear me, please, all i see is hate
i can hardly breathe, and i can hardly take it!

hands on my face, overbearing, i can't get out
hands on my face, overbearing, i can't-

lost, ran at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed
learning from the rush, detached from such and such
bleak, all around me, weak listening, incomplete
i am not a dog, but i'm the one you're dogging

i am in a buried kennel, i have never felt so final
someone find me, please, losing all reserve

hands on my face, overbearing, i can't get out
hands on my face, overbearing, i can't-

you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you i despise

cut me, show me, until i am willing and able and never any danger to myself
knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain, or was my tolerance a phase?
empathy, out of my way, i can't die
i can't die
i can't die
i can't die

you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
you all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you i despise
despise, depise

liberate my madness, i just want to
liberate my madness

section off myself, put a wall up, what the hell have i done?
keep the dog at bay, survive by saving me
i am one, i am all, i'm above and beyond



liberate my madness, i just want to
liberate my madness

i am not ashamed, what is vital isn't always humane
you can break in vain, but you can't break away
i can't see from here, but i can smell your fear

burn

saved? you're such a slave, i don't expect a name
you don't care, i wasn't witness
i can't be part of a system such as this
hard eyes glow right in my darkness again
with the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters
how long have i had this?
i don't need this, outta my business
insert, engage, betrayed, my god
fraud
fraud
fraud

liberate my madness
liberate my madness, i just want to
liberate my madness
liberate my madness


even if you will run, i will find you
i decided i want you, now i know, i need
if you can't be bought, tougher than i thought
keep in mind, i'm with you
never left out fate, can't concentrate
even if you run

you will be mine

i found you leaning out of an open window
you laughed, our fingers clenched
too perfect, far too careless
i couldn't help myself, i just took you

damn it, man, i knew it was a mistake
damn it, man, i knew it was a mistake
damn it, man, i knew it was a mistake
damn it, man, i knew it was a mistake

better make yourself at home, you're here to stay
you won't bother me if you let me bother you
all the doors are locked, all the windows shut
keep in mind, i watch you
even if you run



man, i knew it was a mistake
damn it, man, i knew it was a mistake
damn it, man, i knew it was a mistake
damn it, man, i knew it was a mistake


my freedom is best, whole country's on house arrest and everyone's a suspect
you can't feel the flow because you died, face-down on a suicide
save this, my rage is bliss, i'm taking names and getting pissed

where's chuck d when you need him?


can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
savor every flavor you got, 'cause it's not your own
bad ass at bat, man, forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
breathe, amber-cult, breathe, one more, seethe, freak like you got a pair
won't be my fault when you're painted in the corner of a no-good life, this is-


i can't remember, i don't understand, is it malice that makes you this way?
carry it with you till someone forgives you, i laugh, 'cause there's nothing to say
you can't begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when you're here
none of us wonder what weather you're under, you're making it perfectly clear

can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
you're all reality and sound bites, and the freedom is never in plain sight

it's no kind of life, this is no kind of life, you can't blame me
i can't be, i can't be, i can't be blamed


i'm cold, i'm ugly
i'm always confused by everything
i can stare into a thousand eyes
but every smile hides a bold-faced lie

it itches, it seethes; it festers and breathes
my heroes are dead, they died in my head
thin out the herd and squeeze out the pain
something inside me has opened up again

thoughts of me exemplified
all the real flaws i have denied
forget today, forget whatever happened
every day, i see a little more overall deficiencies
i'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe

what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?

i save all the bullets from ignorant minds
your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
way past good taste, on our way to bad omens
i decrease while my symptoms increase

you act like you knew it all along
your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing
all i ever wanted out of you was something you could never be

what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?

"i haven't got time for the living; i haven't got time for the living"

give me any reason why i'd need you
give me any reason why i'd need you

i see you in me, i see you in me
i see you in me, i see you in me
i see you in me, i see you in me
i see you in me, i see you in me

i keep my scars from prying eyes
incapable of ever knowing why
somebody breathe, i've got to have an answer
why am i so fascinated by bigger pictures, better things
but i don't care what you think, you'll never understand me

what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?
what the hell did i do to deserve all of this?



pain, made to order!
pain, made to order!
pain, made to order!
pain!

i'm not the second coming, i'm the first wave!
better get an army, 'cause the fire left me unscathed
so stick around, 'cause i'll get to you in just a few
step off the "achtung!", get back or get stung
idiotic sense of yourself; are you that dumb?
entire legion of me, totalitarian

'cause i can't stand it, planned, gonna crash-land it
in other words, consider me branded
another version of me, another version of you
both barrels, what you gonna do?

all i hear is human noise!
i belong to only me!
silence for my revelry!

i can only die over time!
filthy hands, stay away from mine!
every reason is a right to hate!
painful clutch, death is fine, give me mine!

only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!

somebody explain this?
you don't care, 'cause you don't exist!
reckoning!

only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!
only one of us walks away!

only one of us walks away! walks away!
only one of us walks away! walks away!
only one of us walks away! walks away!
only one of us walks away! walks away!


i play doctor for five minutes flat
before i cut my heart open and let the air out
three bugs, a pound of dust
some wind spilled before me
in the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout

as i lie there with my tongue spread wide open
a black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
as i injected the candy heart that i selected
she said don't hesitate, just do what you have to do to me

it's hard to stay between the lines of skin
just 'cause i have nerves, don't mean that i can feel
i wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
just let the blood run red 'cause i can't feel

it's hard to stay between the lines of skin
just 'cause i have nerves, don't mean that i can feel
i wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
just let the blood run red 'cause i can't feel

gun against my head, you live when i'm dead!


blood's on my face and my hands and i don't know why
i'm not afraid to cry, but that's none of your business!
whose life is it? get it? see it? feel it? eat it!
spin it around so i can spit in its face
i wanna leave without a trace
'cause i don't wanna die in this place!


whatcha gonna do?
cause i'm not afraid of you!
i'm everything you'll never be!

wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me
cause a line gets crossed when you don't come clean

my wormwood meets your pesticide
you'll never get out, cause you were never alive
i am infinite, i am the infant finite
come a little closer and i'll show you why

no one is safe!

how does it feel to be locked inside another dream
that never had a chance of being realized?
i'll tell you what you're looking at

look in my eyes for the answers, typical
i can feel it underneath like a miracle
everybody in the world needs more than
lies and consequences to power them
once again, it's me and no one else
i can't remember if there was a someone else!
it's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands
and it's shaking; you'll never take me

i'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
the one derivative you manage is the one i abhor
i need a minute to elaborate for everyone the


yeah! yeah! yeah!

i don't mind being ogled, ridiculed, made to feel minuscule
if you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
the only thing you really know about me is...
that's all you'll ever know!

i know why you blame me
i know why you blame yourself
i know why you plague me
i know why you plague yourself

i'm turning it around like a knife in the shell
i wanna understand why, but i'm hurting myself
i haven't seen a lot of reasons to stop it
i can't just drop it!
i'm just a bastard, but at least i admit it
at least i admit it!

i know why you blame me
i know why you blame yourself
i know why you plague me

i think i'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
this is the end of everything
you are the end of everything

i haven't slept since i woke up
this is the end of everything
you are the end of everything

shallow skin, i can paint with pain
i mark the trails on my arms with your disdain
everyday it's the same; i love, you hate
but i guess i don't care anymore

oh, fix my problems with the blade
while my eyes turn from blue to gray
god, the worst thing happened to me today
but i guess i don't care anymore? wrong

since i'm putting down
all of the true things around, but i like it
handed down the crown
given the jewels and the answers of may
thought of being ousted
comes and goes, comes and goes
when i think about it
the wind blows

hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
hate it, hate it, hate it

run me out of town
somewhere a move might intended a gown at
pissed at all the bowels
always the blues and a delicate smile
missed all of the sideways
gull and noun, gull and noun
chills and petty band-aids
wrapped around

hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
hate it, hate it, hate it

good grief

the train that i got onto up and left that town
threw it up as it went down
strange enough it left me rude and turned around
watched as they all took their vows

fools were drawing trying to save that day
i don't doubt that anyway

phase it out until the older ones return
have a seat and watch it burn
trace around the corner this is what i've learned
always waited for my turn

fools were drawing trying to save that day
i don't doubt that anyway

i'm called a cow
i'm not about to blow it now
for all the cows
for all the cows

it's funny how money allows
all to browse and be endowed
this wish is true
it falls into peaces new
the cow is you, the cow is you

my kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend
some time if time allows
everthing worn in, everything worn in
everything worn in like it's a friend

i said you're all a painted doll
and it caused the walls to fall
how far is he?
impatiently
that's as far as far can be
as far can be

leading everything along, never far from being wrong.
nevermind these things at all, it's nothing.
couldn't find a way to you, seems that's all i ever do.
turning up in black and blue, rewarded.

all the static we all left.

wait till the time has come, figure that's where time comes from.
leaving all my senses numb, is heaven.
lifted up the fatal scene, anything could never be.
anything but play to me, in order.

all the static we all left.

take it back for them to keep, fallen into something deep.
not that i had made that leap, anointed.

all the static we all left.

where have all the wishes gone, now that all of that is done?
wish i would've felt i've won, for once.


i stick it to the mailman
i'm pinned against a pot plant
i'm sick of all the sun-tan
oily with the ray-ban

take that to the bank and call it a check
masked without a weapon

i'm skinny as a spit pan
playing with my bad hand
just another rock band

take that to the man
and call it a check
trapped within a contract

hey there boy while you were catching the black widow
the rest of us were watching melrose

i wanna swim in the watershed
i wanna listen to the flowerhead
i lost a gallon and still i bled
i keep on thinking i get ahead

pissed at all the disc jam
pissed about the 5-ham
pissed about the green state
i miss it and i can't wait

take that to the man and call it a check
trapped within a contract

hey man can't you tell it's still a problem?
see you at the devil's tower

i wanna swim in the watershed
i wanna listen to the flowerhead
i lost a gallon and still i bled
i keep on thinking i get ahead

pissed at all the disc jam
pissed about the 5-ham
pissed about the green state
i miss it and i can't wait


i'm not around that much
running exhausted and lost
if it could be undone
will it have costed
it's taught and lost

blowing away we stray, wilted
insulted, at fault
what if the day had stayed in bed
these baubles we've brought
at fault

after the bliss has long ended
this caution this fault
give me a breeze that's long winded
accosted, adult arrested


how i miss you
how i miss you
how i miss you
i should never call
how i hope that you still miss me

did i lose you?
did i lose you?
did i lose you?
somewhere down the line
hide and seek's all right if i find...

do you miss me,
like i miss you
if you miss me,
never go away
hopefully... you'll come stay someday

if you're leaving,
come back soon
that's not easy to say

i will wait here,
and dream of you
all alone as i ache

power is as sacred to that they never even teach
only if it's black or white see the challenges
open eyes are broken if you'd just consider me
cut you loose, i feel like i gotta gotta go!..


soda is left to block away the case of broken heart
spit out fast for fun for it's the only way to win
take my breathe come back inside, oh i gotta gotta go!

i got the answer help yourself
find any answer help yourself
help yourself, help yourself, help yourself...

real life is so hard
we hide in the stars
that's where our heads are
my head and your heart

this is a black out
don't let it go to waste

i want to detonate

when you are so far
i'm falling apart
lose all my sonar
you jam my radar

this is a black out
don't let it go to waste
this is a black out
i want to detonate

sometimes i feel i'm getting stuck

you've got me on guard
i've got my head start
my head and your heart
the same in the stars

this is a black out
don't let it go to waste

i have a choice between the bat and the belt
each time i hear about the hand you've been dealt
spare me confession, it's confession you sell
maybe i'll fall behind but i don't mind because i'll catch up

want a song that's indelible like manimal
i hope you never see me wind up

will i be happy on the back of the shelf
will you be happy when we're sharing a cell
spare me your questions since you know me so well
someday you'll realize that i get shy and i choke up

want a song that's indelible like manimal
i hope you never see me wind up
what is wrong with this animal, i'm terrible
i hope you never see me wind up

farewell my sweet paramania
farewell my sweet paramania

my only promise is that i'll never tell
keep you at a distance from the things that i felt
i'll bite the bullet, take the beating until
i take it all back anyway, what was i supposed to say?

want a song that's indelible like manimal
i hope you never see me wind up

the other day they waited
the sky was dark and faded
solemnly they stated
"he has to die
you know he has to die"

and all the children learning
from books that they were burning
every leaf was turning
to watch him die
you know he has to die

the summer sun looked down on him
his mother could but frown on him
and all the other sound on him
but it doesn't seem to matter

and when the day had ended
with rainbow colors blended
his mind remained unbended
he had to die
you know he had to die

spanish lady come to me
she lays on me this rose
it rainbow spirals round and round
it trembles and explodes

it left a smoking crater of my mind
i like to blow away
but the heat came 'round and busted me
for smiling on a cloudy day


escaping through the lily fields
i came across an empty space
it trembled and exploded
left a bus stop in its place

the bus came by and i got on
that's when it all began
there was cowboy neal at the wheel
of a bus to never-ever land


and when the day had ended
with rainbow colors blended
his mind remained unbended
he had to die
you know he had to die

he had to die
you know he had to die

he had to die
well, you know he had to die


last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born,
black madonna two eagles hang against a cloud,
sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone,
all graceful instruments are known.

when the windows all are broken and your love's become a toothless crone,
when the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,
winter morning breaks, you're all alone.

the eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own,
and touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
this ground on which the seed of love is sown,
all graceful instruments are known.


it seems i have been here before
and i don't want to see anybody cry

you don't have to tell me why

it ain't 'cause i'm the only one left, darling
'bout the time the sun rises west
feeling groovy, looking fine

think i'll come back here again
every now and then, from time to time

my, how lovely you are, my dear
the ball game has gone much too far, my dear
sing to me, do your thing to me

meet me some morning now, meet me some morning


sleepy alligator in the noonday sun
call for his whiskey, he can call for his tea

oh no, well i've been there before
and not coming back around there no more

hung up waiting for a windy day
hung up waiting for a windy day

creepy alligator coming all around the bend
talking 'bout the times when we was mutual friends
i'll check my memory and i check it again, yes i will

oh no! well i've been there before
and i ain't coming back around there no more, no i'm not

riding down the river in an old canoe
a bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
out of the river all ugly and green
the biggest old alligator that i've ever seen

teeth big and pointy and his eyes were bugging out
contracted the union, put the beggars to rout
screaming and yelling, he was picking his chops
he never runs he just stumbles and hops
just out of prison on six dollars bail

alligator running 'round my door
alligator running 'round my door
alligator running 'round my door
alligator running 'round my door

alligator's creeping in and he's crawling around on my cabin floor
he's coming round to bother me some more

alligator
alligator
alligator
alligator

alligator
alligator
alligator
alligator

alligator
alligator
alligator
alligator


i went down one day
i went down one day to see a gypsy woman
just one old day, yes i did

i want to find out, i want to find out, i want to find out now
what's wrong with me and my baby

we ain't been getting down like we used to do
i mean it's pretty good now
but there was a time
when it didn't work too well

i went down to see this gypsy woman, you understand
and i told her my story, i told her what was going on
and she told me, man she said ah
"all you need, all you need
all you need, all you need
all you got to have"

"all you need...
...just a touch"

she said "all you got to have, oh lord"

"just a touch of mojo's hand", oh bring it back on
and it feels pretty good, yes indeed


saint stephen with a rose
in and out of the garden he goes
country garland in the wind and the rain
wherever he goes the people all complain

stephen prospered in his time
well he may and he may decline
did it matter, does it now?
stephen would answer if he only knew how

wishing well with a golden bell
bucket hanging clear to hell
hell halfway twixt now and then
stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

lady finger, dipped in moonlight
writing "what for?" across the morning sky
sunlight splatters dawn with answer
darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye

speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
what a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned

several seasons with their treasons
wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

did he doubt or did he try?
answers aplenty in the bye and bye
talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
one man gathers what another man spills

saint stephen will remain
all he lost he shall regain
seashore washed by the suds and the foam
been there so long, he's got to calling it home

fortune comes a-crawling, calliope woman
spinning that curious sense of your own
can you answer? yes i can
but what would be the answer to the answer man?


when i was just a little young boy,
papa said son, you'll never get far,
tell you the reason, if you wanna know,
cause child of mine, there isn't really far to go.

well, baby baby wants a gold diamond ring,
wants it more than any old thing,
well when i get those jelly-roll blues,
why i go and get anything in this world for you.

down to the jewelry store packin' a gun,
says, "wrap it up i think i'll take this one"
"a thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said,
dupree said, "i'll pay this one off to you in lead".

well you know son, you just can't figure,
first thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
and it's no wonder, your reason goes bad,
jelly-roll will drive you so mad.

judge said, "son, it's gonna cost you some time"
dupree said, "judge you know that crossed my mind"
judge said, "fact it's gonna cost you your life"
dupree said, "judge you know that seems to me to be about right".

baby baby you gonna lose her sweet man,
dupree come out with a losin' hand,
baby's gonna weep it up for a while,
then go out and find another sweet man's gonna treat her with style.

judge said, "son, i know your baby well,
but that's a secret i can never tell"
dupree said, "judge well it's well understood,
but you got to admit that sweet jelly's so good".

well you know son, you just can't figure,
first thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
and it's no wonder, your reason goes bad,

same old story and i know it's been told,
some like jelly jelly, some like gold,
many a man's done a terrible thing
just to get, baby a shinin' diamond ring.


boots were of leather
a breath of cologne
her mirror was a window
she sat quite alone

all around her
the garden grew
scarlet and purple
and crimson and blue

she came and she went
and at last went away
the garden was sealed
when the flowers decayed

on the wall of the garden
no one may come here
since no one may stay


da da da da da da da da da da da

sitting in mangrove valley, chasing light beams
everything wanders from baby to z
baby, baby, pretty young on tuesday
old, like a rum-drinking demon at tea

baby, baby, tell me what's the matter
why, why tell me, what's your why now?
tell me, why will you never come home?
tell me, what's your reason if you got a good one?

everywhere i go, the people all know
everyone's doing that rag
everywhere i go, the people all know
everyone's doing that rag

take my line, go fishing for a tuesday
maybe take my supper, eat it down by the sea
gave my baby twenty, forty good reasons
couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three

rain gonna come but the rain gonna go
stepping off sharply from the rank and file
awful cold and dark like a dungeon
maybe get a little bit darker 'fore the day

hipsters, tripsters, real cool chicks, sir
'cause everyone's doing that rag
hipsters, tripsters, real cool chicks, sir
'cause everyone's doing that rag

you needn't gild the lily, offer jewels to the sunset
no one is watching or standing in your shoes
wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning
everything promised is delivered to you

don't neglect to pick up what your share is
all the winter birds are winging home now
hey, love, go and take a look around you
nothing out there you haven't seen before now

but you can wade in the water and never get wet
if you keep on doing that rag
wade in the water and never get wet
if you keep on doing that rag

one eyed jacks and the deuces are wild
and the aces are crawling up and down your sleeve
come back here, baby louise
and tell me the name of the game that you play

is it all fall down?
is it all go under?
is it all fall down?
is it all go under?
is it all fall down?
is it all go under?
is it all fall down?
is it all go under?

everywhere i go
the people all know
everybody's doing that rag


cold mountain water, the jade merchant's daughter
mountains of the moon, electra, bow and bend to me
hi ho, the carrion crow, folderolderiddle
hi ho, the carrion crow, bow and bend to me

hey tom banjo
hey a laurel
more than laurel you may sow
more than laurel you may sow

hey the laurel
hey the city in the rain
hey, hey, hey the white wheat
waving in the wind

20 degrees of solitude, 20 degrees in all
all the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall
lost is a long and loneliest time, fairy sybil flying
all along the, all along the mountains of the moon

hey tom banjo
it's time to matter
the earth will see you on through this time
the earth will see you on through this time

down by the water the marsh king's daughter
did you know?
clothed in tatters, always will be
tom, where did you go?

mountains of the moon, electra, mountains of the moon
all along the, all along the mountains of the moon
hi ho, the carrion crow, folderolderiddle
hi ho, the carrion crow, bow and bend to me

bend to me


look for awhile
at the china cat sunflower
proud-walking jingle

copper-dome bodhi
drip a silver kimono
like a crazy-quilt stargown

krazy kat peeking
through a lace bandana
like a one-eyed cheshire
like a diamond-eye jack

a leaf of all colors plays
a golden string fiddle
to a double-e waterfall
over my back

comic book colors
on a violin river
crying leonardo words
from out a silk trombone

i rang a silent bell
beneath a shower of pearls
in the eagle wing palace
of the queen chinee


waves of violet go crashing and laughing
the rainbow winged singing birds fly 'round the sun
sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn

what's become of the baby this cold december morning?

songbirds frozen in their flight
drifting to the earth, remnants of forgotten dreaming
calling... answer comes there none.
go to sleep you child, dream of never-ending always

panes of crystal, eyes sparkle like waterfalls
lighting the polished ice caverns of khan,
but where in the looking-glass fields of illusion
wandered the child who was perfect as dawn?

what's become of the baby this cold december morning?
what's become of the baby this cold december morning?

racing rhythms of the sun
all the world revolves captured in the eye of odin
allah, pray, where are you now?
all mohammed's men are blinded by the sparkling waters
scheherazade gathering stories to tell
from primal gold fantasy petals that fall

but where is the child who played with the sun chimes?
and chased the cloud sheep to the regions of rhyme?
stranded stream cries the south wind
lost in the regions of lead
shadow-like chains of illusion, delusions of living and dead.


cosmic charlie, how do you do?
truckin' in style along the avenue
dum-dee, dum-dee, doodley-doo
go on home, your mama's calling you

kalico kahlia, come tell me the news
calamity's waiting for a way to get to her
rosy red and electric blue
i bought you a paddle for your paper canoe

say you'll come back when you can
whenever your airplane happens to land
maybe i'll be back here too
it all depends on what's with you

hung up waiting for a windy day
kite one ice since the first of february
mama keeps saying that the wind might blow
but standing here, i say i just don't know

new ones coming as the old ones go
everything's moving here but much too slow now
a little bit quicker and we might have time
to say "how do you do?" before we're left behind

calliope wail like a seaside zoo
the very last lately inquired about you
it's really very one or two
the first you wanted, the last i knew

i just wonder if you shouldn't feel
less concerned about the deep unreal
the very first word is "how do you do?"
the last "go home, your mama's calling you"

calling you
calling you
calling you
calling you

calling you
go on home, your mama's calling you
calling you
go on home, your mama's calling you
calling you
go on home, your mama's calling you

go on home, your mama's calling you


dark star crashes
pouring its light into ashes

reason tatters
the forces tear loose from the axis

searchlight casting
for faults in the clouds of delusion

shall we go, you and i, while we can?

mirror shatters
in formless reflections of matter

glass hand dissolving
to ice petal flowers revolving

lady in velvet

shall we go, you and i, while we can

high green chilly winds and windy vines
in loops around the twisted shafts of lavender,
they're crawling to the sun.

underfoot the ground is patched
with arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita,
stark and shiny in the breeze.

wonder who will water all the children of the garden
when they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
droop so hungry neath the sky.

william tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
no furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before.

no more time to tell how, this is the season of what,
now is the time of returning with our thought
jewels polished and gleaming.
now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein,

seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll,
six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow,
five men writing with fingers of gold,
four men tracking down the great white sperm whale,
three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
riding in the whalebelly, fade away in moonlight,
sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below.

on our own away again,

blistered, cracked, and bleeding
cold, no one should know
rain falls down a freezin'
and stickin' like a snow

lingering suspicions
screamin' in my head
lies all mixed up with omissions
aw welcome home again

it's too late for apologies
they're falling at my feet

this is just the way of the world joe said
i had to put a bullet into his head
an' then he lit up a cigarette
he decided to call up his fat friend fred
well he said fred i just killed a man
i caught him laying with my girlfriend
an' now they're both dead
dudes can be so cold when they're dead

callin' all the neighbors
time to make amends
whiskey floods the table
aw good friends 'til the end

an' they're makin' silly faces
and it's tastin' bitter sweet

this is just the way of the world joe said

dirty belly of a secret town
cheap trick hookers that are hangin' out at the bar
near the greyhound station
and the bare-chested boys are going down
on every thing that the momma believes
pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
help you feel not so strange

said old pa, "she don't get off
unless somebody's standing near her

hands all tied to a chair"
i said, "lay it now on the ground
throw in a white noise sound

fingers in the dirt, spitting out his teeth
spitting out his teeth

weeds blow tall on a broken train track
ruth b. draws we're fixin' to get high
maybe we'll hit the bluffs and find ourselves the same old rum

but everybody says this place is beautiful
and you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
but everything's the same, this town is pitiful
and i'll be gettin' out as soon as i can fly

life goes by on a talihina sky

i just don't know where leading ladies come from
i just don't know where they can be found

she's opened up just like she really knows me
i hate her face but enjoy the company
i'll take you home or back to oklahoma
you're not so nice but sex sells so cheap

and standing on a pigeon toe in his disarray
straight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet you

let the good times roll, let the good times roll
cowgirl king of the rodeo
let the good times roll, let the good times roll

good time to roll on

she has problems with drinking milk and being school tardy
she'll loan you her toothbrush, she'll bartend your party

you'll be the one to always complain
three in the morning come a-bang, bang, bang
all out of fags and i just can't wait

cancel the thing that i said i'd do
i don't feel comfortable talking to you
'less you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
then i'll be in the lobby drinking for two

balding star
golden
fallen heart

look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
everyone's gathered to idolize me
i hate the way you talk, your japanese scream

it's been too long since i left the shed
you kick the bucket and i'll swing my legs
always remember the pact that we made
too young to die, but old is a grave

eighteen

fallen heart

i'm a-gonna show the way

i used to see you every day
i used to see you every day
i danced around your folk and soul
i left you with your nose a bleedin'
and your toes creepin' around
ah, so mundane and incomplete
hand me down my pants and get me off this street

i'm passed out in your garden
i'm in, i can't get off
so soft
i'd pop myself in your body
i'd come into your party
but i'm soft

behind the fringe of a whiskey high
mutilating cat like eyes
and in your nose, blood decadence
you try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
you paint my fingers and you paint my toes
you let your perfect nipple show

i'm passed out in your garden
i'm in, i can't get off
so soft
i'd pop myself in your body
i'd come into your party
but i'm soft
but i'm soft

i'm passed out in your garden
i'm in, i can't get off, i'm so soft
i'd pop myself in your body
i'd come all over your party, but i'm soft


just like the girlies back at corner stone
wash my bugle boy a watching my throne
sweet mutilations of a sold to nothing man
lord, have mercy, shake is falling through your hand

razz the kid

because you love me, i'm the chosen one
these are the days to not be having no fun
i listen back to what you told me before
just tell me where to come, i'll knock down the door

razz the kid
razz the kid

razz the kid
razz the kid
razz the kid


toss me a breath when you hold me down
hot like a razor on my face
something's growing that don't help me now
paging the doctor, just in case

low and behold things are killing me
silly expectation of a dream
girls are gonna love the way i toss my hair
boys are gonna hate the way i seem

she's tryin' to make the best of the hometown blues blues
blues blues blues blues


well the moon sank, as the wind blew.
and the street lights slowly died.
yeah, they call you the wild one, said stay 'way from her.
said she couldn't love no one if she tried.

but then somethin' i saw in your eyes
told me right away that you were gonna hafta be mine, honey.
well and the strangest feelin' came over me, down inside.
no matter what it takes i'll never get over, how good it felt,
when you finally held me, i will never regret.
those few hours, linger on in my head,
forever.

well it's too bad, but i want you,
to know i understand.
yeah it's been a long time, but i don't mind,
yeah it's alright, i understand.

because somethin' i saw in your eyes,
told me right away that you were gonna hafta be mine.
honey, the strangest feelin' came over me, down inside.
i knew right away i'd never get over, how good it felt,
when you finally kissed me, i will never regret.
those few hours linger on in my head,
forever.


there was hardly any moon
and no one really saw much
no one was really sure
but something didn't seem right
something was kinda queer
a roar turned into whispers
everyone stood there

as the sound split the ngiht
they ran hiding from the light

well i didn't see no shotgun
i didn't see no knife
but i saw this crazy black guy
with the demon in his eye
and i heard him say "white man"
i've seen that silver cue
you don't remember me well
but i remember you

they ran hiding from the light

well the knife just left his fingers
as the black guy took his aim
white guy's head exploded
the black gut howled in pain
then everybody scattered
i heard some woman scream
god damn you old black bastard
you've blown away my dreams

they ran hiding from the light


strange voice on the telephone
tellin' me i better leave you 'lone
why don't somebody say what's going on
uh oh, i think i been through this before

looks like i'm the fool again
looks like i'm the fool again
i don't like it
i don't like it

you never said you had no number two
i need to know about it if you do

well, she was an american girl
raised on promises
she couldn't help thinking that
there was a little more to life
somewhere else

after all it was a great big world
with lots of places to run to
yeah, and if she had to die
tryin', she
had one little promise she was gonna keep

oh yeah, alright
take it easy, baby
she was an american girl

she stood alone on the balcony
yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
out on 441 like
waves crashing on the beach

and for one desperate moment there
he crept back in her memory
god, it's so painful when something that's so close
is still so far out of reach

oh yeah, alright
take it easy, baby
she was an american girl

from a table across the room
she was signaling me with her eyes
i walked over to be introduced
i said, "hello", she just smiled
and said, "i know a place
not too far from here
we could get away for a while"
yeah, that's when she kissed me
and told me her name
i never did tell her mine

magnolia
i remember the smell
of the wind through the sweet magnolia
and i know that she's out there
somewhere in the world
she's forgotten me but i remember her
magnolia

well her lips were as warm
her eyes were as black as the sky
and i wondered aloud
just what i had done right
as i lay there, with her by my side
then she took hold of my hand
as she looked up at me
and said, "now i must tell you goodbye"
and there in the moonlight
as i watched her leave
i felt a chill down inside

oh, magnolia
i remember the smell
of the wind through the sweet magnolia
and i know that she's out there
somewhere in the world
she's forgotten me but i remember her
magnolia

i remember the smell
of the wind through the sweet magnolia

well, the talk on the street says you might go solo
good friend of mine saw you leavin' by your back door

if you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
because i don't know how long
i can hold on
if you're makin' me wait

we don't talk too much about it
ain't no real big secret all the same
somehow we get around it

listen, it don't really matter to me, baby
you believe what you want to believe
you see, you don't have to live like a refugee

somewhere, somehow, somebody
must have kicked you around some
tell me why you wanna lay there
and revel in your abandon

honey, it don't make no difference to me, baby
everybody's had to fight to be free
you see, you don't have to live like a refugee
now baby, you don't have to live like a refugee

tied up, taken away, and held for ransom

you know sometimes, i don't know why
but this old town just seems so hopeless
i ain't really sure, but it seems i remember the good times
were just a little bit more in focus

but when she puts her arms around me
i can somehow rise above it
yeah, man when i got that little girl standin' right by my side
you know, i can tell the whole wide world shove it, hey!

here comes my girl, here comes my girl

every now and then i get down to the end of the day
and i have to stop and ask myself why i've done it
it just seems so useless to have to work so hard
and nothin' ever really seems to come from it

and then she looks me in the eye and says,
"we're gonna last forever"
and man, you know i can't begin to doubt it
no, 'cause it just feels so good and so free and so right
i know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it - hey!

here comes my girl, here comes my girl

every time it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more
i find myself having to reach out and grab hold of something
yeah, i just catch myself wondering, waiting, worrying
about some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'

and then she looks me in the eye and says,
"we're gonna last forever"
and man, you know i can't begin to doubt it
no, 'cause it just feels so good and so free and so right
i know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it - hey!

here comes my girl, here comes my girl


well, it was nearly summer, we sat on your roof
yeah, we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon
and i showed you stars you never could see
babe, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me

baby, time meant nothing, anything seemed real
yeah, you could kiss like fire and you made me feel
like every word you said was meant to be
no, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me

baby, even the losers
get lucky sometimes
even the losers
keep a little bit of pride

there goes my baby, there goes my only one.
i think she loves me, but she don't wanna let on.
yeah, she likes to keep me guessin',
she's got me on the fence with that little bit of mystery,
she's a complex kid and she's always been so hard to figure out.
yeah, she always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt.

she don't like workin', she says she hates her boss,
but she's got me askin' questions, she's got me on the fence
with that little certain something, she's a complex kid,
and she's always been so hard to get around.
yeah, she always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt.
just a shadow of a doubt, she says it keeps me runnin'.
i'm trying to figure out if she's leadin' up to something

and when she's dreamin', sometimes she sings in french,
but in the morning, she don't remember it.
but she's got me thinking 'bout it,
yeah, she's got me on the fence
with that little bit of mystery, she's a complex kid,

and she's always been so hard to live without.
yeah, she always likes to leave me, with a shadow of a doubt.

or else you'll find yourself being the rival
the great lord before he died
knelt sinners by his side
and said, "you're gonna realise tomorrow"

no i'm not gonna tell you
what you already know
'cause time and time again
the old man said it all a long time ago
come come on the time is right
this evil man will fight
i told you once before

wouldn't you like to know?
just like i said before
great king rat was a dirty old man
and a dirty old man was he
the last time i tell you?
would you like to see?


in the land where horses born with eagle wings
and honey bees have lost their stings
there's singing forever
lions den with fallow deer
and rivers made from wine so clear
flow on and on forever
dragons fly like sparrows through the air
and baby lambs where samson dares
to go on on on on on on

my fairy king can see things
he rules the air and turns the tides
that are not there for you and me
ooh yeah he guides the winds

my fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
to run like thieves and to kill like knives
to take away the power from the magic hand
to bring about the ruin to the promised land

they turn the milk into sour
like the blue in the blood of my veins
why can't you see it
fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
son of heaven set me free and let me go
sea turn dry no salt from sand
seasons fly no helping hand
teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes

someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
broken my fairy circle ring
and shamed the king in all his pride
changed the winds and wronged the tides
mother mercury mercury
look what they've done to me
i cannot run i cannot hide

so sad her eyes
smiling dark eyes
so sad her eyes
as it began

upon my brow the lightest kiss
i walked alone
and all around the air did say
my lady soon will stir this way
in sorrow known

the white queen walks
stars of lovingness in her hair

heeding unheard
pleading one word
so sad her eyes
she cannot see

how did thee fare what have thee seen
the mother of the willow green
i call her name
and 'neath her window have i stayed
i loved the footsteps that she made
and when she came

white queen how my heart did ache
and dry my lips no words could make
so still i wait

my goddess hear my darkest fear
i speak too late
it's forevermore that i wait
dear friend goodbye
no tears in my eyes
so sad it ends as it began


you never heard my song before
the music was too loud
but now i think you hear me well
for now we both know how
no star can light our way
in this cloud of dark and fear
but some day, one day...

funny how the pages turn
and hold us in between
a misty castle waits for you
and you shall be a queen
today the cloud it hangs
over us and all is grey
but some day, one day...

when i was you and you were me
and we were very young
together took us nearly there
the rest may not be sung
so still the cloud it hangs
over us and we're alone
but some day, one day...

we'll come home

happy little day, jimmy went away
met his little jenny on a public holiday
a happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"it's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
i'll weave my spell"

"jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say ?"
"oh no i must away to my mum in disarray
if my mother should discover how i spent my holiday
it would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
i'll say farewell"

o rock of ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
o lady moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"we must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"oh no i'm compromised, i must apologise
if my lady should discover how i spent my holidays..."

they line up like it's some kind of ritual

oh give me a good guitar
and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
or just find me an open car
i'll make the speed of light outta this place

i like the good things in life
but most of the best things ain't free

when you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
young and you're crazy...

oh give me a good guitar
and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
or just find me an open car
i'll make the speed of light outta this place

there was a king who ruled the land
his majesty was in command
with silver eyes, the scarlet eagle
showered silver on the people
oh mother, tell me more

why'd'you have to leave me there
hanging in my infant air, waiting
you only have to read the lines of
scribbly black and everything shines

across the stream with wooden shoes
bells to tell the king the news
a thousand misty riders
climb up higher once upon a time

wondering and dreaming
the words had different meaning
yes they did...

for all the time spent in that room
the doll's house darkness old perfume
and fairy stories held me high
on clouds of sunlight floating by
oh mother, tell me more
tell me more...


alone in the clouds all blue
lying on an eiderdown, yippee
you can't see me but i can you

lazing in the foggy dew
sitting on a unicorn no fear
you can't hear me but i can you

watching buttercups cup the light
sleeping on a dandelion too much
i won't touch you but then i might

screaming through the starlit skies
traveling by telephone
hey ho here we go
ever so high

alone in the clouds all blue
lying on an eiderdown, yippee
you can't see me but i can you

doctor, doctor, dark doom
gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
used spool, june gloom

music seems to help the pain
seems to motivate the brain
doctor, kindly tell your wife
that i'm alive, flowers thrive
realise, realise

i want to tell you a story
about a little man if i can
a gnome named grimble gromble
and little gnomes stay in their homes
eating, sleeping, drinking their wine

he wore a scarlet tunic
a blue-green hood, it looked quite good
he had a big adventure
amidst the grass, fresh air at last
wining dining biding his time

and then one day
hooray, another way for gnomes to say
ooh my...

look at the sky, look at the river
isn't it good?
look at the sky, look at the river
isn't it good?

winding, finding places to go

and then one day
hooray, another way for gnomes to say
ooh my ooh my...

the black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere, he didn't care
he stood in a field where barley grows

his head did no thinking his arms didn't move
except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground
he stood in a field where barley grows

the black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
but now he's resigned to his fate 'cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind
he stood in a field where barley grows

i'll give you anything, everything if you want things

there was a king who ruled the land
his majesty was in command
with silver eyes, the scarlet eagle
showered silver on the people
oh mother, tell me more

why'd'you have to leave me there
hanging in my infant air, waiting
you only have to read the lines of
scribbly black and everything shines

across the stream with wooden shoes
bells to tell the king the news
a thousand misty riders
climb up higher once upon a time

wondering and dreaming
the words had different meaning
yes they did...

for all the time spent in that room
the doll's house darkness old perfume
and fairy stories held me high
on clouds of sunlight floating by
oh mother, tell me more
tell me more...


the black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere, he didn't care
he stood in a field where barley grows

his head did no thinking his arms didn't move
except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground
he stood in a field where barley grows

the black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
but now he's resigned to his fate 'cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind
he stood in a field where barley grows


i want to tell you a story
about a little man if i can
a gnome named grimble gromble
and little gnomes stay in their homes
eating, sleeping, drinking their wine

he wore a scarlet tunic
a blue-green hood, it looked quite good
he had a big adventure
amidst the grass, fresh air at last
wining dining biding his time

and then one day
hooray, another way for gnomes to say
ooh my...

look at the sky, look at the river
isn't it good?
look at the sky, look at the river
isn't it good?

winding, finding places to go

and then one day
hooray, another way for gnomes to say
ooh my ooh my...

arnold layne had a strange hobby
collecting clothes
moonshine, washing line
they suit him fine

on the wall hung a tall mirror
distorted view
see-through baby blue

don't go where other you must know
i'm very very very frail

got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
feeling good at the top
shopping in sharp shoes
walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool
but the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
apples and oranges
apples and oranges

cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
to meet the people
she's on time again
and then
i catch her by the eye then i stop and have to think
what a funny thing to do 'cause i'm feeling very pink
apples and oranges
apples and oranges

i love she
she loves me
see you
see you
see you


thought you might like to know
i'm the lorry driver man
she's on the run
down by the river side
apples and oranges
apples and oranges

sitting in a club with so many fools
playing to rules
trying to impress but feeling rather empty
i had another drink
drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink

what a way to spend that evening
they all turn up with their friends
playing the game
they're in the scene always should have been
far away
away - away - away - away - away
getting up, i feel as if i'm remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget

pretend the phone rings and someone speaks
she would very much like to go out to a show
so what can i do - i can't think of what to say
she sees through anyway
away - away - away - away - away

out of the front door i go
traffic's moving rather slow
arriving late, there she waits
looking very angry, as cross as she can be
be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be
getting up, i feel as if i'm remembering this scene before
i open the door to an empty room
then i forget

there was a boy whose name was jim
his friends, they were very good to him
they gave him tea, and cakes and jam
and slices of delicious ham
oh mother tell me more

why'd'you have to leave me there
hanging in my infant air, waiting
you only have to read the lines of
scribbly black and everything shines

the chief defect of henry king
was chewing little bits of string
at last he swallowed some which tied
itself in ugly knots inside

wondering and dreaming
the words have different meanings
yes they did

finding she was left alone
went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
summoned the immediate aid
of london's noble fire brigade

for all the time spent in that room
the doll's house darkness old perfume
and fairy stories held me high
on clouds of sunlight floating by
oh mother tell me more
tell me more


it would be so nice
it would be so nice
it would be so nice
to meet sometime

everybody wakes, and in the morning
hot tea and can't stop yawning
pass the butter please
have you ever read the daily standard?
reading all about the plane that's landed
upside down?

and no one knows what i did today
there can be no other way
but i would just like to say

it would be so nice
it would be so nice
it would be so nice
to meet sometime
it would be so nice
it would be so nice
it would be so nice
to meet sometime

everybody cares about the weather
and everybody should know better
what a waste of time
everybody lives beneath the ceiling
living out a dream that sends them reeling
to a distant place

but no one knows what i did today
there can be no other way
but i would just like to say

on the streets where you live, girls talk about their social lives
they're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
all your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
but you were living in another world, tryin' to get a message through

no one heard a single word you said
they should have seen it in your eyes
what was going 'round your head

ooh, she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast
all those things he couldn't say
ooh, she's a little runaway

i see you out on the streets, call me for a wild time
so you sit home alone 'cause there's nothing left that you can do
there's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

she don't really mind
it's only love she hopes to find

ooh, she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast
all those things he couldn't say
ooh, she's a little runaway

no one heard a single word you said
they should have seen it in your eyes

i know the game you play, i know it well
you just keep on playin' when all the bets are down

roulette you're goin' round in a spin,
caught up in a game you just can't win
roulette, you're just a fantasy
it's everything that you want it to be

restless lovers pay the price, cheating hearts don't think twice

when you make the rules no one can slow you down
you just keep 'em waiting when you're on the prowl

roulette you're goin' round in a spin,

what more can i do, there's nothing i haven't tried
still it's so hard for her to notice
i've tried hard to be straight
there's nothing left i can say
if only she would look my way

she doesn't even know my name

i dream of when she'll be mine
i dream of crossing that line
and holding her so tender
dreaming it could come true
so many things i would do
if only you'd give me a chance



shot through the heart
it's all part of the game that we call love

would you be content to see me crying
after all those little games you put me through
after all i've done for you you're lying
wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth

didn't somebody somewhere say
you're gonna take a fall
i gave you everything
now here's the curtain call

and i am
shot through the heart as i lay there alone
in the dark through the heart
it's all part of the game that we call love

now you've come back here to say you're sorry
ha i just don't know who you're talking to
it could be the man i used to be, girl
but i've grown up and now i'm over you

standing there just a live wire
with nowhere left to turn
you were gonna set the world on fire
but you never learned?

and i am
shot through the heart as i lay there alone
in the dark through the heart
it's all part of the game that we call love

didn't somebody somewhere say
you're gonna take a fall
i gave you everything

and baby must have what she sees
but not this time, the tables turned
baby, you just got burned

and i am
shot through the heart as i lay there alone
in the dark through the heart

i was lost, then i found you
never thought it would be this way
i showed you my heart, left it unguarded

now you're gone, the pain goes on and on

love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines
you're just a number of the love lies

all alone you call it survival
he lost at love to a stranger's lines
walking the streets, searching with vengeance

time goes on, all signs of life stolen, simple dreams were all broken
best of times become desperation but how many tears must you cry to survive

love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines
you're just a number of the love lies

both men knew only one would stay
scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet
and took his life away

you been burned baby lessons learned

too much is never enough

running wild
when me and my boys hit the streets
right on time

"biggest brown eyes i ever seen"
"oh baby"
"hey baby, wanna take a ride on the bus?"
"with your mom"

out of love
out of love
out of love
out of love






one heart one other
they met last summer
one move she started
now they love this way
the pain of pleasure
lying together
you're at their mercy
as the telephone's ringing on

risk your life for a stolen kiss

we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love
we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love

each move goes so slow
until the doors close
no secret codes now
no words as baby goes down
one last dance then goodbye
practicing his love lies
he runs to his wife
and you're left holding the knife

you live your life to take that chance
when you're a master of the art of romance
and you know you won't cross that line
until that last slow dance

we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love
we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love

alone our lonely hearts would die.
it's all in the game
and the way that it's played
there's no time to wonder why
to catch you when you fall
answer when you call
no one can hear you cry

we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love
we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love


you need someone to hold you tight
sometimes love don't know wrong from right
another long and senseless
fight was all you knew they're all the same
there's no one left to take the blame
what's behind this masquerade
how do we win these losin'
games we play, words we say
cutting wounds we know they run so deep
leave it all behind you
or someday love will find you

only lonely -- i can't stop hurting you
only lonely -- but i can't stop loving you
only lonely -- how much pain does it take

it's getting sometimes i don't know
when to stop when to go
sometimes we're so afraid to let it show
a stolen kiss so out of place
it wipes the smile right off your face
and when those feelings start
we let them go, let them go

games we play, words we say
cutting wounds that run so deep
leave it all behind you
or someday love will find you

only lonely -- i can't stop hurting you
only lonely -- but i can't stop loving you
only lonely -- so tell me babe, how much pain
can you take before your heart breaks?

i got this timebomb ticking in my head
this time i think she's gonna blow
how can i say get away
when i just can't let go

games we play, words we say
cutting wounds that run so...
leave it all behind you
or someday love will find you

only lonely -- i can't stop hurting you
only lonely -- but i can't stop loving you
only lonely -- how much pain does it take


listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out
there's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls
maybe now that i got you let me tell you what i'm talking 'bout

i been down and mistreated
now we're standing undefeated

i'm the king of the mountain
i'm the king of the hill
i'm the king of the mountain
i'm the king of the hill

you spend your life working 9 to 5 it's like doing time
boss man says "hey boy, you'll never be no good"

i been down and mistreated

now we're standing undefeated...

i'm the king of the mountain
i'm the king of the hill

after the smoke clears
when it's down to you and i
when the sun appears
and there's nothing left but goodbyes
we'll just turn and walk away
how could we let it end like this
just turn and walk away
should we seal it with a kiss

it's too late
now you're out and on the run
it's too late
held up in love without a gun

we hold up our candle light
no words to say
and we're both too tired to fight
just hold me close and don't let go...

it was all so simple when
you were to be queen and i'd be your king
i guess those dreams got lost
cause baby you're still you and i'm still me
now letting go
it's always the hardest part to fight
when we both know

it's too late
too late to wonder why
much too late
to save a love that's died.

we hold up our candle light
no words to say
and we're both too tired to fight
just hold me close and don't let go...

just hold me close and don't let me go

after the smoke cleared
it was down to you and i
when the sun appeared
there was nothing left but goodbyes...


in the heat of the street of the city
a young boy hides the pain
and he walks so tall, trying to hang on
but he knows he's going down again
i know he's going down...

darkness fades he's the prince of his city
in a place where they all know your name
you can see in their eyes life so paralyzed.
you're just a pawn in a losin' game
you lose at life it ain't no game

hear their cries
stay alive

all alone in a place where the lonely
they all have to walk through the rain
and they dance on the edge where you only
only pray that it has to end

hear their cries
stay alive

these four walls they could tell you some stories
about lying and dying and fame
there's a price that you pay for the glory
about losing and choosing and pain.

hear their cries
stay alive


the clock strikes ten
out on the streets again
i been looking for something to please me since i don't know when
out on the dark side of town
another rumble's gone down
and life on the high side isn't what this boys about

she's got something i want man, it's something i need

i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby, i can always run

to a heart of chrome
and a soul of steel
we've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal
and when i give her the gun
you know she feels so right
and we don't let go when we're alone when i'm holding her so tight

she's got something i want man, it's something i need

i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby, i can always run

and when the morning comes and i go to sleep
when i close my eyes she's waiting for me

i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby, i can always run


we would take no prisoners
'cause there was nobody giving in
they came walking through my jungle
and met an angel about to sin
i heard a voice from inside of me
can you help me, hear me call

to the fire
to the fire

when you're a part of society
you know, the heart of your innocence dies
when we met with authority
i looked him right between the eyes
'cause all we had was our innocence
all we had was our hearts to try to win the fight you tell me...
can you save me, from it all

to the fire
to the fire

to the fire
to the fire

can you help me, hear me call
can you save me, from it all...

to the fire
to the fire


riding high, then shot down
i load my guns to fire another round
i look deep into your eyes
and can't run there's nowhere left to hide
don't stop, no it's much too late
oh i live, love to lose control
it makes me crazy i want to let you know

oh, no, i don't want to fall
oh, oh, can't you hear me calling
you tell me i'm the one
when i'm next to you -- next to you.
all i want in my secret dreams
is you here with me.
i got to get to you, get to you, get to you.

there's a thrill, in the chase
we won't lose when we meet face to lace.
love, games a means without and end.
i go down but i'll be back again
when you're with me in my sleep.

oh, no, i don't want to fall
oh, oh, can't you hear me calling
you tell me i'm the one
when i'm next to you -- next to you.
all i want in my secret dreams
is you here with me.
i got to get to you, get to you, get to you.

i can see you
i need you
but i'm only dreaming
you tell me i'm the one
when i'm next to you -- next to you.
all i want in my secret dreams
is you here with me.


the weekend comes to this town
seven days too soon
for the ones who have to make up
what we break up of their rules

well i saw captain kidd on sunset
tell his boys they're in command
while chino danced a tango
with a broomstick in his hand
to break on through to the other side

let it rock, let it go
you can't stop a fire burning out of control
let it rock, let it go
you got to let it rock

we go down to the broadway
where everybody goes
to get on their rockin' horse
and blast that radio
well i saw roxie on the table
her girlfriend down below
they'll give it to the king of swing
before it's time to go

to break on through to the other side

let it rock, let it go
you can't stop a fire burning out of control
let it rock, let it go
you got to let it rock


shot through the heart
and you're to blame
darling, you give love a bad name

an angel's smile is what you sell
you promised me heaven and put me through hell
chains of love got a hold on me
when passion's a prison, you can't break free

whoa-oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
whoa-oh, there's nowhere to run
no one can save me
the damage is done

shot through the heart
and you're to blame
i play my part and you play your game
you give love a bad name

paint your smile on your lips
blood red nails on your fingertips
a schoolboy's dream, you act so shy
your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

whoa-oh, you're a loaded gun
whoa-oh, there's nowhere to run
no one can save me
the damage is done

shot through the heart
and you're to blame
i play my part and you play your game
you give love, oh

ohh, shot through the heart
and you're to blame
you give love a bad name
i play my part and you play your game

shot through the heart
and you're to blame
i play my part and you play your game




"dr. bon jovi, report to emergency..."

you can read it in the papers
in some places it comes in thirty-two flavors
but you wouldn't tell no one
your favorite if you could

from the white house to the alleys
from the president down to long tall sally
can't live with it but
you'll die without it - yes you would

senorita's in the kitchen
she's a fistful of dynamite

you can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that i guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease

where you look you can find it
try to run but you're always behind it
so you play hide and seek like a blind kid
till you're caught - yeah you're caught

so you'll say that you had some
but they took it and held it for ransom
were they tall, dark, skinny or
handsome - you won't talk

so you telephone your doctor
just to see what pill to take
you know there's no prescription
gonna wipe this one away

you can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that i guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
love is a social disease
love is a social disease

let the boy show you, baby!

she's so full of high grade octane
she could run the bullet train on 38 double d's
now you know for sure, you know the cure
to make a blind man see

you can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that i guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
love is a social disease

you can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that i guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
love is a social disease, baby
love is a social disease

nothing a shot can't cure!


it's all the same, only the names will change
every day, it seems we're wasting away
another place where the faces are so cold

i'm a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride
i'm wanted, dead or alive
wanted, dead or alive

sometimes i sleep, sometimes it's not for days
the people i meet always go their separate ways
sometimes you tell the day
by the bottle that you drink
and times when you're alone, all you do is think

i'm a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride

oh, and i ride

yeah

i'm a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride

and i walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
i play for keeps 'cause i might not make it back
i've seen a million faces and i've rocked them all

'cause i'm a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride


dead or alive
dead or alive
dead or alive
dead or alive


ooh!

ooh, yeah!

you, you got a nasty reputation
we're in a sticky situation
it's down to me and you
so tell me, is it true?
they say there ain't nobody better
well, now that we're together
show me what you can do

you're under the gun
out on the run
out on the run
under the gun
playin' to win

raise your hands
when you want to let it go
raise your hands
when you want to let a feeling show
raise your hands
from new york to chicago
raise your hands
from new jersey to tokyo
whoa-whoa, raise your hands

i, i've been out on the front line
where you'll go down if you waste time
they'll walk all over you
but i, i ain't here looking for surrender
i'll raise the flag if you'll defend her
it's up to you

you're under the gun
out on the run
out on the run
under the gun
and playin' to win

you've got to raise your hands
when you want to let it go
raise your hands
when you want to let a feeling show
raise your hands
from new york to chicago
raise your hands
from new jersey to tokyo
whoa-whoa, raise your hands
whoa-whoa, raise your hands

all right, let's go!

raise your hands...
raise your hands...

raise your hands
when you want to let it go
raise your hands
when you want to let a feeling show
raise your hands
from new york to chicago
raise your hands
from new jersey to tokyo
whoa-whoa, raise your hands

new york!
detroit!
vancouver!
hey, london!
sayreville, new jersey!
phoenix!
anywheres i haven't been...


she wasn't young, but still a child
there still was innocence
in painted smiles
she called to me as i passed her by
but one thing always stays the same

without love, there's nothing without love
nothing else feels right without love

i saw a man down on lonely street
a broken man who looked like me
and no one knows the pain that he's been living
he lost his love and still hasn't forgiven
but one thing always stays the same

without love, there's nothing without love
nothing else feels right without love

there's nothing without love
nothing else but love can burn as bright
and nothing would mean nothing without love

i see my life
some things i took for granted
love's passed me by
so many second chances
i was afraid
i won't be afraid no more

without love, there's nothing without love
nothing else feels right without love

there's nothing without love
nothing else but love can burn as bright
and nothing would mean nothing without love

there's nothing without love
nothing without love


if you could see inside my heart
then you would understand
i'd never mean to hurt you
baby i'm not that kind of man

i might not say i'm sorry
yeah, i might talk tough sometimes
and i might forget the little things
or keep you hanging on the line

in a world that don't know romeo and juliet
boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
we are cast from eden's gate with no regrets
into the fire we cry

i'd die for you
i'd cry for you
i'd do anything
i'd lie for you
you know it's true
baby i'd die for you
i'd die for you
i'd cry for you
if it came right down to me and you
you know it's true, baby i'd die for you

i might not be a savior
and i'll never be a king
i might not send you roses
or buy you diamond rings

but if i could see inside you
maybe i'd know just who we are
'cause our love is like a hunger
without it we would starve

in a world that don't know romeo and juliet
boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
we are cast from eden's gate with no regrets
into the fire we cry

i'd die for you
i'd cry for you
i'd do anything
i'd lie for you
you know it's true
baby i'd die for you
i'd die for you
i'd cry for you
if it came right down to me and you
you know it's true, baby i'd die for you


as i sit in this smokey room
i pass my time with strangers
but this bottle's my only friend

remember when we used to park
on butler street out in the dark
remember when we lost the keys
and you lost more than that in my backseat, baby

remember when we used to talk
about busting out - we'd break their hearts
together - forever

never say goodbye, never say goodbye
you and me and my old friends
hoping it would never end
never say goodbye, never say goodbye
holdin' on - we got to try
holdin' on to never say goodbye

remember days of skipping school
racing cars and being cool
with a six pack and the radio
we didn't need no place to go

you and me we had a fight
but the band they played our favorite song
and i held you in my arms so strong

we danced so close
we danced so slow
and i swore i'd never let you go
together - forever

never say goodbye, never say goodbye
you and me and my old friends
hoping it would never end
say goodbye, never say goodbye
holdin' on - we got to try
holdin' on to never say goodbye

i guess you'd say we used to talk
about busting out
we'd break their hearts
together - forever

never say goodbye, never say goodbye
you and me and my old friends
hoping it would never end
say goodbye, never say goodbye
holdin' on - we got to try
holdin' on to never say goodbye


joey comes from a sacred part of town
where sometimes you talk so tough
that your feet don't touch the ground
while the old men recite their story lines
about when i was young like you
they say "oh yeah"
we were cruising to the backbeat
oh yeah, making love in the backseats
we were wild, wild in the streets

a member of the boy's brigade
had a date with the girl next door
you know it made her daddy crazy
but it only made her want him more
they weren't looking for trouble
so she headed out through her bathroom window
what her daddy didn't know was gonna be all right
they said "oh yeah"
we were cruising to the backbeat
oh yeah, making love in the backseats
we were wild, wild in the streets
wild, wild in the streets
wild, wild in the streets
wild, wild in the streets

sometimes this town ain't pretty
but you know it ain't so bad
just like a girl who looks so happy
when inside she's so so sad
in here we got this code of honor
nobody's going down
you don't walk in vain
trough the kid's parade
'cause this is my hometown


hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!

"they say that to really free your body

lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me

if you're ready, i'm willing and able
help me lay my cards out on the table
you're mine and i'm yours for the taking
right now the rules we've made are meant for breaking

what you get ain't always what you see
but satisfaction is guaranteed
they say what you give is always what you need, whoa-whoa
so if you want me to lay my hands on you

lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
all you gotta do is
lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
now listen up!

i'm a fighter, i'm a poet, i'm a preacher
i've been to school and baby i've been the teacher
if you show me how to get up off the ground
i can show you how to fly and never ever come back down

everything you want is what i need

but the ride don't never ever come for free, no-oh-oh

you are the sun and moon and stars, are you?
and i could never run away from you

you try at working out chaotic things
and why should i believe myself, not you?

it's like the world is going to end so soon
and why should i believe myself?

you, me and everything
caught in the fire
i can see me drowning
caught in the fire

you, me and everything
caught in the fire
i can see me drowning
caught in the fire


when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul

i want you to notice
when i'm not around
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here, oh oh

she's running out the door
she's running out
she run, run, run, run
run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here
i don't belong here


he's bitter and twisted
he knows what he wants
he wants to be loved and
he wants to belong
he wants you to listen
he wants us to weep
and he was a stupid baby
who turned into a powerful freak

but how do you?
how do you?
how do you?

he lives with his mother
but we show him respect
he's a dangerous bigot
but we always forget
and he's just like his daddy
'cause he cheats on his friends
and he steals and he bullies
any way that he can

but how do you?
how do you?
how do you?


and the wise man say, "i don't want to hear your voice"
and the thin man say, "i don't want to hear your voice"

and they're cursing me
and they won't let me be
and there's nothing to say
and there's nothing to do

stop whispering, start shouting
stop whispering, start shouting

and the mother say, "we spit on your son some more"
and the buildings say, "we spit on your face some more"

and the feeling is
that there's something wrong
because i can't find the words
and i can't find the songs

stop whispering, start shouting
stop whispering, start shouting

dear sir, i have a complaint

dear sir, i have a complaint
can't remember what it is

it doesn't matter anyway
it doesn't matter anyway

stop whispering
stop whispering
stop whispering
stop whispering, start shout...

i fought hard, died hard

everytime you're running
out of here
everytime you're running
i get the fear

i never wanted any broken bones
scarred face, no home
your words surround me and i asphyxiate
and i burn all hate

everytime you're running
out on me
everytime you're running
i can see

i'm not a vegetable
i will not control myself
i spit on the hand that feeds me
i will not control myself

all over me
the waters break, the waters run
and this time you're gonna pay

i'm not a vegetable
i will not control myself
i spit on the hand that feeds me

nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
hooked back up to the cathode ray
i'm better off dead

i want to breathe, i want to grow
i'd say i want it but i don't know how

please forget the words
that i just blurted out
it wasn't me, it was
my strange and creeping doubt

it keeps rattling my cage
and there's nothing in this world will keep it down

and even though i might, even though i try
i can't
even though i might, even though i try
i can't

soon your things that keep
that keep me underground
so many words that i
that i can never find

if you give up on me now
i'll be gutted like i've never been before

and even though i might, even though i try
i can't
even though i might, even though i try
i can't

i got something
i got something heaven knows
i got something
i got something i don't know


in my mind
i'm nailed to heels
all the time
killing what i feel

turns to stone
turns to stone

i am fused
just in case i blow out
i am glued
just because i crack out

everything i touch
turns to stone

killer cars, cars
killer cars

too hard on the brakes again
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they don't get outta the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?

i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping the steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

don't die on the motorway
the moon would freeze, the plants would die
i couldn't cope if you crashed today
all the things i forgot to say

i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
what if the car loses control?
what if there's someone overtaking?

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

killer cars
hey, uh

i never wanted anything but this
i worked hard, tried hard
i ran around in domestic bliss
i fought hard, died hard

everytime you're running
out of here
everytime you're running
i get the fear

i never wanted any broken bones
scarred face, no home
your words surround me and i asphyxiate
and i burn all hate

everytime you're running
out on me
everytime you're running
i can see

i'm not a vegetable
i will not control myself
i spit on the hand that feeds me
i will not control myself

the waters break, the waters run
all over me
the waters break, the waters run
and this time you're gonna pay

i'm not a vegetable
i will not control myself
i spit on the hand that feeds me
i will not control myself


you are the sun and moon and stars, are you?
and i could never run away from you

you try at working out chaotic things
and why should i believe myself, not you?

it's like the world is going to end so soon
and why should i believe myself?

you, me and everything
caught in the fire
i can see me drowning
caught in the fire

you, me and everything
caught in the fire
i can see me drowning
caught in the fire


when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul

i want you to notice
when i'm not around
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here, oh oh

she's running out the door
she's running out
she run, run, run, run
run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here
i don't belong here


faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but
it hurts like hell
my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen
from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are losing it
can't you tell?
we scratch our eternal itch
and we are grateful for
our iron lung

the headshrinkers, they want everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon
the headshrinkers, they want everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out
we'll just hum
this, this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

the headshrinkers, they want everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon
the headshrinkers, they want everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon

and if you're frightened, you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
and if you're frightened, you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay

the headshrinkers, they want everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon
the headshrinkers, they want everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon


rust in the mountains
rust in the brain
the air is sacred here
in spite of your claim

up on the roof tops
out of reach
trickster is meaningless
trickster is weak

he's talking out the world
talking out the world

hey

we're talking out the world
talking out the world

hey

truant kids- a can of
brick dust worms who do not want to

i wrapped you inside my coat
when they came to firebomb the house
i didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
now that i'm held in your spell

a beautiful girl
a beautiful girl
can turn your world into dust

sell me a car that goes
sell me a house that stands, oh
i never cared before, i never cared before
i never cared before, before, before, before

a beautiful girl
a beautiful girl
can turn your world into dust

a beautiful girl

can turn your world into dust

i stood in front of her face
when the first bullet was shot


the easiest way to sell your soul is to carry on believing that we don't exist
it must be hard
with your head on backwards


i am gone
everybody's raging
and these fruits
they still taste of poison

i won't be around
when you really need me

i can't sleep
why can't someone hold me?
i need warm
my restless body cracks and moans

i won't have the strength
when you really need me


i must get out once in a while
everything is starting to die
the dust settles, the worms dig
spiders crawl over the bed

i must get out once in a while
i eat all day and now i'm fat
yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
you never wash up after yourself


when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul

i want you to notice
when i'm not around
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doin' here?
i don't belong here
i don't belong here


you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form

you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home
saying

everything is
broken
everyone is
broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone

you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss it, you can break all the rules
all of the rules

has taken a turn

ooh oh, and all i taught her was
everything
ooh oh, i know she gave me all that she wore

and now my bitter hands
chafe beneath the clouds
of what was everything

i can feel their laughter
so why do i sear?

ooh oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
'round my head
i'm spinning, oh, i'm spinning
how quick the sun can
drop away

and now my bitter hands

violins
center of her own attention, the
mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
tries to make her proud

the shades go down, it's in her head
painted room
can't deny there's something wrong

don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
don't call me

she holds the hand that holds her down
she will rise above
ah

don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
don't call me daughter, not fit to be
the picture kept will remind me

don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
don't call me daughter, not fit to be
the picture kept will remind me
don't call me

the shades go down
the shades go down
the shades go

i wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
what to say? what to say?
but soon she was down, soon he was low
at a quarter past, a holy no
she had to turn around

when she couldn't hold, oh, she folded
a dissident is here
escape is never the safest path
oh, a dissident, a dissident is here

and to this day, she's glided on
always home but so far away, like a word misplaced
nothing said, what a waste
but when she had contact with the conflict
there was meaning but she sold him to the state
she had to turn around

when she couldn't hold, she folded
a dissident is here
escape is never the safest path
oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
oh, oh, oh

she gave him away when she couldn't hold
no, she folded
a dissident is here
escape is never the safest path
oh, a dissident, a dissident is here

oh, couldn't hold on
she couldn't hold, no, she folded
a dissident is here
escape is never the safest place
oh, a dissident is here


he won the lottery when he was born
took his mother's white breast to his tongue
trained like dogs, color and smell
walks by me to get to him
police man, police man

he won the lottery by being born
big hand slapped a white male american
do no wrong, so clean cut
dirty his hands, it comes right off
police man, police man

police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police man, police man

jesus greets me, looks just like me

do no wrong, so clean cut
dirty his hands, it comes right off
police man, police man, police man

police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police man, police man

police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again
police stopped my brother again

one way needle
pulled so slowly

drains and spills
soaks the pages
fills their sponges

turn ed into one of his enemies

it's my blood
it's my blood

stab it down
fill the pages
suck my blood dry

i took a drive today
time to emancipate
i guess it was the beatings made me wise
but i'm not about to give thanks or apologize

i couldn't breathe, holding me down
hand on my face, pushed to the ground
enmity gauged, united by fear
forced to endure what i could not forgive

i seem to look away
wounds in the mirror waved
it wasn't my surface most defiled

head at your feet, fool to your crown
fist on my plate, swallowed it down
enmity gauged, united by fear
tried to endure what i could not forgive

saw things
saw things
saw things
saw things
clearer
clearer
once you were in my rear view mirror

once and for all, i'm far away
i hardly believe, finally the shades are raised
hey, yeah

saw things so much clearer
rearviewmirror
saw things so much clearer
rearviewmirror
saw things so much clearer
rearviewmirror

saw things so much clearer
once you
oh yeah


they don't eat, don't sleep
they don't feed, they don't seethe
bare their gums when they moan and squeak
lick the dirt off a larger one's feet

they don't push, don't crowd
congregate until they're much too loud
drink the blood of their so-called best friend

they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
don't pack themselves together and run as one
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare

they don't scam, don't fight
don't oppress an equal's given rights
starve the poor so they can be well-fed
line their holes with the dead one's bread

they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
don't pack themselves together and run as one
don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare

they don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
don't pack themselves together and run as one
don't take what's not theirs

they don't compare
rats, they don't compare
rats, they don't compare

i seem to recognize your face
haunting, familiar, yet i can't seem to place it
cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
lifetimes are catching up with me

all these changes taking place
i wish i'd seen the place
but no one's ever taken me
hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away

i swear i recognize your breath
memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
me, you wouldn't recall for i'm not my former
it's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf

i changed by not changing at all
small town predicts my fate
perhaps that's what no one wants to see

i just want to scream hello
my god, it's been so long
never dreamed you'd return
but now here you are and here i am
hearts and thoughts, they fade away

hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away

hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away
hearts and thoughts, they fade


troubled souls unite

i am fuel, you are friends
we got the means to make amends
i am lost, i'm no guide
but i'm by your side
i am right by your side, yeah

young lover, i stand
it was their idea, i proved to be a man
it was their idea, i proved to be a man

will myself to find a home
a home within myself
we will find a way
we will find our place

drop the leash, drop the leash
drop the leash, drop the leash

drop the leash, we are young
drop the leash, we are young
drop the leash, drop the leash
get outta my, my

delight, delight, delight in our youth


i will light a match this morning so i won't be alone
watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone
oh, i will stand arms outstretched, pretend i'm free to roam
oh, i will make my way through one more day in hell

how much difference does it make?
how much difference does it make?

i will hold the candle until it burns up my arm
oh, i'll keep taking punches until their will grows tired
oh, i will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
hey, i won't change direction and i won't change my mind

how much difference does it make?
how much difference does it make?

i'll swallow poison until i grow immune
i will scream my lungs out till it fills this room

how much difference?
how much difference?
how much difference does it make?
how much difference does it make?


lives opened and trashed
look, ma, watch me crash
no time to question
why'd nothing last?

grasp and hold on
we're dying fast
soon be over
and i will relent

let the ocean swell
dissolve 'way my past
three days and maybe longer
won't even know i've left

under your tongue
i'm like a tab
i will give you
what you're not s'posed to have.

under my breath
i swear by sin
for better or worse
a best we began

let the sun climb
oh, burn 'way my mask
three days and maybe longer
shed my skin at last, shed... shed.

let the sun shine
burn 'way my mask
three days and maybe longer
won't ever find me here

let the ocean
dissolve 'way my past
four days and not much longer
let my spirit pass

this is, this is
this is, this is
this is, this is
this is, this is my last exit
